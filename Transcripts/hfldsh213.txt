every Pioneer is responsible for setting up and managing efficient pipelines outposts and power infrastructure sorry
3:23
I can't hear you what's up do you know if there's a way to invite me in yet ored Planet are with resources suable
3:29
for direct use or further investigation stay within your design going invite you to watch that is
3:36
why the world is counting on Pioneers like you fix it solutions to
3:43
problems options no initiating server manager
3:49
no atmosph I'm in like a tutorial right now I don't know if that's I mean once you get out of there
3:57
you see in a little bit acceptable parameters what's up
4:07

5:25
boarding they're better first Contact safety tools supplied due to presence of

alien MEAP ad here to fix it procedure and equip the fix it Xeno zapper before
5:36
leaving the drop zone I'm loud like it's loud and you're quiet it's like
5:45
a where is the option manage session manage players
5:51
manage session uh can I invite you like normal
5:57
can I do this and then tab maybe I do see if
6:05
it if you can invite me or no it's not letting me add C
6:12
no like this is a no this is a session that allows manage
6:19
session join by invite only yep I guess I'll just I'll just open it
6:24
up open for friends player count one of four
6:30
see you en join on
6:37
me do you have a way to um oh uh hold on let
6:45
me oh I can just perfect okay let me do this and then I'm just going to send you this code I
6:51
guess does that do anything for you uh is it what I think it is uh I
6:59
don't know what that is that's what it gives me when I manage session session settings
7:05
session ID and then I send it to you and then I assume you can use that to join the
7:13
game how do I invite other players got it you got it I think I
7:22
did that is the weirdest thing ever but okay so this is just basically 3D facts
7:29
where I have no idea it appears that way oh
7:35
yeah see if I load in so I'm going to I'm going to go back to [Music]
7:40
join by invite only so nobody else can sneak their way in
7:55
here so I played a little bit right connection timed out Closing Connection
8:01
Daniel has left the game I guess I'm going to open it back up to open for
8:07
friends maybe that was the reason you might have to host [Music] this I have no idea why this
8:15
is it says you're a loading screen it says you're oh North oh it kicked me out
8:22
again no kick me out the first time I didn't really I was still loading
8:31
this is something Dragon drop equipment to hand slot to
8:36
equip all right let me try joining again oh press F to enter dismantle dismantle
8:43
the drop pod fixated as cost effective and efficient we do not waste the drop
8:49
pod will be recycled to construct the first stage of the habitat in utility base often referred to as the Hub hello
8:56
yo
9:08
press F to enter to oh goodness hold left Mouse button
9:17
uh what's up man what's the what's what's the deal y next objective I spawn it seems like that additional iron
9:24
to be able to build I'll make my way over if you cannot find iron be assured scan of the planet have revealed
9:30
sufficient iron sources picking up a bunch of leaves on my way
9:37
over oh I'm heading to you and iron at the same time I'm heading to
9:49
you unbelievable I do like the fact this
9:55
game has no uh what hunger oh hunger yeah oh oh look at him go look at him go
10:04
oh oh oh next objective use to construct The
10:11
Hub iron is a base component necessary for all near future progress so ensure you build the Hub close to iron sources
10:19
Fixit does not pay by the kilometer getting beat
10:25
up the jumping is like super weird C to open build menu okay we fight this
10:34
guy yeah you just stab him with your little little gun oh what is this gun
10:42
for not for that glad we both oh hello pick up hog
10:52
remains samples of new alien species acquired notable features are blunt
10:58
teeth suggesting it is herous and a thickly PL the heart of your factory this is where you
11:03
compl Milestones to unlock additional schematics for buildings Vehicles part The Remains for later oh my this thing's
11:10
big all right where you want to where you want to build it uh where are you I already lost you by this like water Pond
11:16
here we want to build it close to the iron thingy oh like the iron deposit
11:23
yeah just cuz it's you have to do a lot of walking and it's easier if it's right
11:28
next to us I mean at least in the beginning until we yeah yeah no I'm go with this
11:34
all right I'll drop it I'll drop it over [Music] here uh I can see it that's really cool
11:41
you can see me like holding it I can hold yeah yeah yeah if you press um I think t or
11:46
H you can hold it in place and you can walk around it oh and you like give it a look yeah you can see how it like looks
11:53
on the yeah that's cool how do I like rotate uh with the scroll oh interesting
12:00
I a nudge with the mouse I assume I have to not be in lock anymore yeah do we
12:06
have a preference for what direction uh so what you want to look for is the little indications like it
12:13
has like a square that has like orange so like on this side you can see that it's orange right this now it's
12:21
orange on your side Orange right or does it just show you like the two electricity bolts
12:27
Orange right Orange two electricity bolts then no I'm not seeing I don't know I
12:34
don't know what you see on on your screen I okay so let's pretend that this is the side that is orange what does
12:41
that mean all right you have electricity bolts that show up here uh these will be your inputs okay or at least where you
12:48
can put stuff into okay uh right now this is the side where you'll be seeing a lot of like your energy being put into
12:55
it so you can power up your machines okay so where do we want that to face it really doesn't
13:01
matter not at this St all right hub Foundation built the Hub terminal and
13:08
crafting bench are only the humble beginnings of a successful fix it Pioneer but essential for the next steps
13:13
of onboarding once finished the Hub will function as your base of operations next
13:19
objective complete Hub upgrade one old T old T oh
13:33
all right uh Hub upgrades and their cost can be found and activated in the hub terminal I got a follow no way no way
13:42
from thank you who'd you get uh Alexis Alexis yeah thank you Alexis thanks
13:51
Alexis do I have to activate a milestone no Milestone selected there's no Milestone to select so click on where it
13:58
says tier zero tier zero oh and then Hub upgrade one yep and you can select that
14:05
Milestone okay and then now we need to create 10 iron rod for resources okay is
14:11
that what we do here so this is where we can craft uh select recipe iron
14:19
Rod can't you have any iron on
14:27
oh uh H the crafting is a little
14:32
strange yeah oh we need 10 of them
14:43
yep all right I got 10 iron oh I probably didn't need that many that's all right is there any reason to have
14:50
raw iron uh no you want to convert those into uh iron uh in ingots
15:01
okay uh do I drag it yeah there probably
15:07
should be like a hockey or something to like drag Drop Like quickly like in Minecraft but I don't know if okay shift
15:12
shift left click seem to work oh we got like a roof Hub upgrade
15:19
one storage and frame completed equipment like the port made in the work what did we oh we
15:25
got this congratulations first milestone the first of many providing access to new
15:31
recipes and Technologies for the fix admission next objective complete Hub
15:36
upgrade two Hub upgrade two rewards the smelter the power line
15:44
copper ingots and wire cable wow a lot right all right what do we
15:52
need we need 20 rods and 10 uh ingots so
15:58
we need a lot of [Music] iron on it yeah I was doing that while
16:04
you were crafting the first one so I got like a 100 oh my God how do I
16:12
see how much I have uh when you mine something the number that's in parenthesis tells you
16:18
how much of that one item you have
16:24
oh and then if you press on tab or I I think it opens up your inventory tab
16:32
yeah okay only one of us can use the crafting MCH at a time I see yeah how
16:38
many rods do we need 20 rods 10 [Music]
16:45
ingots how much time do you have in the game so far uh couple
16:52
hours uh 6.2 hours oh wow
17:00
you can make the plates well yeah I'll get more iron what do we need uh the the
17:05
plates ples yeah oh it takes two
17:11
ingots I think the way we should do this is whoever is crafting the other person mines the IR that that checks out yeah
17:20
all right I have the plates I just chove it in there [Applause]
17:26
yeah oh upgrade two power and shell completed
17:32
the smelter can turn such as copper and iron into ingots and the biomass burner
17:37
generates power when fueled biomass bur fun fact most of the Native flora and fauna is compatible with Fixit
17:44
technology fueling the biomass burner with inappropriate materials will result in deductions or even cancellation of
17:51
your yearly bonus next objective complete Hub upgrade three yep let's see
17:58
all right so right here we can do a little bit of
18:05
automation uh press q and you click on the smelter and you can see this guy that
18:11
I'm holding [ __ ] is that what is that this is the smelter that's the smelter
18:16
yeah thing is gigantic yeah so you see this little orange thing that I'm talking about now oh yeah can you see
18:24
that yeah yeah I couldn't see that before I I didn't see it before I thought I could but I thought it was
18:29
just crazy okay so the Orange is the input side blue is the uh
18:36
output so once we get more stuff that's automated we can actually start like feeding the conveyor belts into it and
18:42
like you know actually doing a production line okay what what was that that was a
18:49
smelter where is that in the back here so if you press Q you uh you're currently probably in
18:56
special if you C down production yeah yeah oh what's a power line and why do I have
19:02
two of them uh power lines are uh cables
19:08
all right so you connect one to the power supply which is the biomass burner and then one to the item you're trying
19:15
to power and then you want to pick up any leaves wood and anything you can
19:25
see okay because that's going to be our primary source of f fuel I see we're going to need
19:32
copper yeah where's the nearest copper how do
19:39
I oh 46
19:44
M
19:53
no where's the nearest copper uh this way I
19:59
think this way that look like iron to me is there like a
20:05
map uh unlock it later I'm looking at the
20:19
pings oh well the copper is above us
20:27
[Music]
20:39
uh so in my playthrough my copper is also really far away
20:44
so is this
20:51
it that's iron
21:02
ah I found it where are you back of the ship
21:09
okay damn I still have enough [ __ ] iron for
21:17
this so far away
21:38
no there's just no way oh cuz cuz I'm stupid what are you doing hello Silver
21:45
Wing one two three I keep like mining iron but then I'm not
21:50
uh I'm looking at the wrong number for what is necessary for the iron
21:56
plates uh okay I have uh our two friends
22:02
here where are you you mean to get out there like what's up um I'm mining oh okay I guess
22:10
copper I guess I got to do the going like a lot of
22:18
it potential edible collected if consumed before authorized is compatible
22:23
with the human diges system I fix it the consumer is responsible for any and all
22:28
I'm a big fan of bashing my head against the wall for for a while I got I got my boy he's got some hours on me I got some
22:36
hours like six he's got some hours and man I got minutes
22:41
okay it's some it's
22:47
some I hear the Wolves what's the safe
22:57
now well take some damage no I'm on my way back
23:02
woo got 100 copper oh man how do you mine uh trees uh do we need like a tool you need
23:11
a tool all right you can find like wood on the floor oh but besides not nothing
23:20
much you said to grab leaves right yeah I'm not just being an idiot picking up all these leaves all right no no we need
23:26
a lot of leaves yeah I'm glad there's no
23:32
stamina and it appears though there's no hunger no there's no hunger uh the food
23:39
heals you H it's like old Minecraft it's so great
23:50
yeah all right makes a bunch of making wires now
24:00
put this in here upgrade oh you're back at the house Hub
24:06
upgrade three interior Furnishing completed the Constructor can produce simple parts and power poles allow for
24:13
the expansion of the power grid when you make the inevitable mistake Fixit dismantling feature is designed to
24:20
salvage all resources used during construction in line with our zero waste policy we understand that fix it
24:27
pioneers are only human and thus prone to error next objective complete Hub
24:33
upgrade four where'd you go oh hop right now oh come come inside the building
24:39
real quick yeah I saw that we got like a living room now we can uh customize our character oh yeah
24:44
baby oh ooh no
24:51
way no way look at me you see
25:05
say anything I'm trying to get my looks man I'm trying to get the
25:14
drip to get drippy drippy trinket oh on the
25:23
gun primary color oh for the headset oh yeah
25:30
oh yeah what is
25:48
this
25:54
uh it's the most important part of this game
26:03
making sure you look somewhat
26:10
drippy that's good enough I saw the big head where'd you go
26:19
I'm right next to you hey Big Head hey man what's
26:26
good all right uh um we need copper we we need the wires
26:33
we need some sandbags and some more plates sandbags
26:39
sandbags oh my word my materials sandbag no they're concrete concrete yeah uh we don't have
26:46
this we don't have the material to make it currently when to get
26:51
concrete cable we need copper wire I'm going to make the copper wires
26:57
in a second okay you got to look for the other thing
27:02
the other thing the the Limestone Limestone use your uh
27:12
scanner it's all just rock like how do you how do you know like
27:18
what's the the scanner yeah I'm clicking V but it always looks like iron no well if you
27:25
drag it around you click the Limestone it looks like rocks well I drag it around and click the
27:33
Limestone and let go you should be seeing I mean I I found one accidentally but I I don't know what would tell me
27:41
that it's Limestone uh if
27:48
you uh let me look at your screen real quick all right press on your um scanner
27:55
button
28:02
hold the button oh I didn't know that you could choose what you're looking for I thought
28:08
I just scanned everything oh well that makes a lot more sense so
28:14
there's one over here which is the one you're Mining and then there's one over the other side as well oh word that
28:20
makes way more sense actually put the that's how you were able to find the copper yeah
28:34
press o to open the [Music]
28:43
Codex how do you make the cable oh that's right the wires the copper yeah
28:49
the Copper's right above you you got to go up that hill Oh that's I'm just checking out the
29:00
you methoding me a few more
29:09
[Music] concretions so from the amount that I've
29:16
played limestone's only useful for making concrete so that sounds about right I
29:23
bet it's like concrete and like decoration maybe yeah that's how it was that's how was in
29:29
factorio you use Stone to make like furnaces and then pretty much after that it's
29:36
[Music] useless oh I guess I should get the do
29:42
we need more copper is him uh yeah we're always nice to have copper oh you're
29:47
already you're done you're done with the copper wires oh wow wait how do we finish we need more Copp how we finish the how we finish the
29:54
concrete I put them in oh I grabbed some from
29:59
behind the uh the
30:06
base all right so we could do this one of two
30:12
ways uh we start building some stuff to make our lives
30:18
easier or we can um manually make 75 pieces of
30:26
iron uh [Music]
30:36
uh yeah I mean I know how I would do it but I'm
30:42
willing man I would manually make all of them that's what I did too I'll go get more C until until the
30:49
game tells me not to I'm going to keep making it I put my iron in here as long as as
30:55
well as my copper oh okay let get
31:03
more that should be enough to make uh 75 yeah you should be able to see like how
31:10
many you can make yeah it says it on the
31:19
left this what I think it is you hold space too that's
31:25
great and then you can also hold e when you're walking and you can automatically pick up things
31:33
oh so you don't have to keep pressing e whenever you walk past the
31:45
leaf Hub upgrade 4 Landing platform and utilities completed conveyor
31:51
bels monitors input of another and transport resources uh I believe there's
31:57
a game been asked to issue a clarification miners obviously do not
32:02
have a connection for conveyor belts there is nothing to suggest visually or functionally that they can be connected
32:09
to Portable miners if this is something you struggle with do not worry fix it
32:15
has alternative uses for all their Pioneers next objective complete Hub upgrade
32:23
five we'll get the minor mark one the storage container three more in slots
32:29
it's just more of the same [ __ ] yeah what do we need for the uh next uh thing oh 50 I see it
32:42
[Music]
33:04
what do we need for the portable miners or do we unlock that next you got
33:09
to give me a second I'm I'm playing the mini game right now all right I did the same thing I was like oh
33:16
whoa whoa how do I play this [Music]
33:41
[Music] [ __ ]
33:46
[ __ ] [ __ ] send it
33:55
[Music]
34:00
if I can see what you're
34:05
[Music]
34:16
[Music] playing okay anyways all right what do
34:24
we me to do more more Limestone yeah I mean I have some in the uh in the
34:37
[Music] chest we probably need more iron let me know
34:52
you're I'm making the uh what's it called just let me know
34:57
when the crafting men just free we could build another one that'd be great we should build another
35:03
one how do we do that look to see what we need to build it
35:10
craft oh it's just I can make that right now it's just rods and
35:16
gears unfortunately the bench is occupied so I can't really can't really make another bench until the bench is
35:24
done uh oh almost done give me a
35:30
second hey hey whoa whoa whoa whoa the way Buck I'm almost done I'm
35:35
almost
35:40
done all right I got 50 cables nice dep positive you can go ahead and
35:47
use the CRA very kind yeah it didn't seem like you were
35:53
in any rush to not at all no not at all right
36:01
right where should I put our new crafting
36:06
MCH right next to it I can't the other one I can't put it really close by right uh I
36:15
assume whatever is going here is probably Untouchable I just shove it like right
36:23
here yeah place it
36:31
nice have you been to the cave in the Ravine with the blue shrums yet we are on HUB upgrade five do you think I've
36:39
been to the Ravine with the blue I what is either I haven't made it that far
36:45
either all my uh
36:58
any iron I have some M but not enough I'm just going to pick up from the chest and
37:05
just make it from there I'm going to be
37:14
[Music]
37:23
lazy the show on the road
37:29
well if you're curious when you're at the Copper node it's basically below it
37:34
huh I don't know copper node the copper node
37:40
whatever the copper node is I got 31 iron [Music]
37:46
rods I'm out of iron though back to Mining and
37:53
[ __ ] more copper or what
37:59
cables cables we're done with cables
38:04
sir I I don't want to keep mining uh or crafting
38:10
iron so I made a
38:18
smelter okay you made a
38:24
smelter okay eight wires all right so how do we power
38:29
it uh remember those all those leaves we made you pick up oh we put it in this guy here the biomass burn all right so
38:36
what does this do it uh smelts our uh iron ore for
38:42
us one less crafting we have to
38:49
do that's some [ __ ] [ __ ]
38:55
son look at you look like
39:00
it and I'm going to power it on real quick let see how you do
39:08
that he dro the Lees put 166 leaves in there 20
39:15
Mega and the smelter is acting crazy and it's making us uh one iron it's making
39:21
30 iron per minute
39:29
where does the iron come out or is that is that only for you can pick it up and
39:34
you can drag it out of the uh inventory slot there all
39:43
right and then is there a equipment Workshop is
39:50
the other thing we should make I had to learn this the hard way
40:04
up do cuz they don't explain to you nothing
40:11
in this game absolutely
40:20
nothing all right what did you make M this is the
40:25
equipment Workshop Workshop here is where you can make another one of these little gun things or stabies
40:33
and other stuff why we need another one we don't I just say this where we can make it and then uh there's also
40:39
portable miners in okay so portable miners it sounds is going to be it can
40:47
do a lot of the mining for it sounds it sounds pretty awesome except it can't
40:53
uh it can't have a export on them you can't can you not just pull out of
40:59
it no you have to like grab it manually yeah yeah that's what I mean like I can't
41:06
yeah I need
41:14
iron some of those Hub upgrade five power expansion
41:20
completed the miner unlike portable miners can be connected to conveyor belts and requires power to fun ction
41:28
caution as you expand the energy demand of your production May exceed the capacity of your power grid the
41:35
onboarding program was established because Fixit Pioneers often experience memory issues after planetf if you are
41:42
experiencing nose bleeds nausea existentialism or an itchy scalp there is no need for concern this should pass
41:50
within 5 to 7even work days next objective complete Hub upgrade six okay
41:56
Hub upgrade six like that last one didn't really have any upgrades to it it
42:01
does space elevator yeah biomass biomass burner three inventory
42:10
slots yep thank you Jacko thank you
42:17
Jacko all right all right so what are we so in here in the personal storage
42:25
box I made a portable Miner it takes up a couple of iron plates and
42:30
uh some rods okay so pick that up and place it over
42:35
by the uh iron and you can see how it works how do I take something out of my inventory and put it into your
42:43
hands into my hands oh hello oh my it's purple drop it off over here what on top
42:49
of the iron spot here I was going to do it over here this one
43:09
now this guy is cool does he so this gu is going to be does he require power no that's great
43:18
free energy right here wow the only downside is that you can't
43:24
pull from him automatically and if he reaches 100 ore then uh
43:33
stops uhhuh so is that burner just going to be burning even if we're not doing
43:39
anything uh I gu I should haveck I guess I should have checked before
43:47
I all right I turned off the burner so does the biomass thing
43:54
stop uh it does appear as though it is
44:00
stopped you put shoot no I didn't do anything I just turn I I just stopped producing iron
44:06
iron wow yeah how smart is that W you added another one yeah man
44:13
this is great we should go make another one for the copper and the Limestone exae yep yep
44:21
now you get it this is great all right I'll go make one I
44:27
plates you need four rods and a couple iron plates where are the
44:33
miners uh you have to go to the equipment uh equipment guy yeah and so
44:40
the good thing about having a bunch of these guys is that they can be used to make the actual
44:45
minor which you need power yeah and those you can grab uh out
44:51
of and apply into the smelter to have that automatic be
44:59
done oh we're not there
45:05
[Music] yet
45:14
okay you going for the other one over there yeah I but I I made two okay all right I'll I'll not make
45:21
another one then
45:28
uh what else do we need we need a
45:38
Constructor uh where are you going to the Copper yeah going to the Copper all
45:43
right press q and go to the buildings and you see that little plus uh button
45:49
that appears on the top right of the items nope uh if you hover over one uh a
45:57
little plus sign appear here you can add it to your to-do list and it tells you how many items you need press Q there's
46:03
a plus sign up here okay yeah yeah sure and it tells you what you need so that
46:09
you know we can what we need to build for okay what do you want to do the Constructor yeah can you see that now on
46:15
my screen or no I I couldn't see it before I before you like if I it seems
46:21
like it's individual like when I add it I see a different thing than so take it off yeah I still have
46:29
mine I think it's individual individual yeah okay cool reinforced iron plate eight
46:39
cables in the in the furnace can we put both um copper and iron no no has to be
46:49
separate see we to build another furnace yeah all right
46:59
oh dear wow pretty good fall
47:05
damage uh what do I need I need
47:11
cables I need eight cables what are you making uh Constructor okay I'll make the
47:18
other furnace oh I need copper
47:30
uh how how much copper do you need uh I got enough I think
47:44
okay okay and I re reinforce plates which I need
47:51
screws I think I need 12 I need 24
48:02
I
48:20
need no power how do I get power
48:28
uh how do I this up
48:35
actually do I need like do I need the all right so power line to connect
48:41
these things you need the the so we have cables power lines and we have uh power
48:47
pole Mark ones right okay which are These Guys these guys can take four uh
48:53
connections whereas the power lines can only do one okay so should we make one and then
49:00
connect all of them to that one we need a power pole Oh I thought you had one I don't have one I I I need a copper and
49:07
then some uh concrete what's I can make
49:17
it I have like no concrete on me what am I missing
49:24
concrete yeah all right where do we want it and like
49:30
in the middle uh sure the cables go really far
49:38
huh so then now uh we want to erase this power line
49:46
here right it's going to shut off the machine and you want to start connecting the cables to the uh items that you want
49:53
to power I have no cables
49:58
there we go so now those two should be powered on
50:09
now how do and it least us with one extra line you hit it up to the top
50:16
here click and you have to click somewhere else so like
50:23
yeah yep how do you how do you remove the connection uh F oh and you can remove the power
50:30
line individually do you get the resources back you
50:35
do that's why I say it doesn't really matter where we put stuff down right now because we can always move it up
50:42
later cool so what do you want the Constructor to make uh I assume right now we want the
50:49
base and stuff so iron plates and iron rods all right so let's set it up for
50:55
iron plates okay I put some of my iron in
51:00
there and then we're going to build a conveyor belt across but we need six iron plates which I don't
51:16
have oh oh hello there we
51:21
go automation one
51:41
so we need another Constructor for the copper yeah before that we should make um uh a
51:52
miner like a real minor a real Miner yeah
51:58
all right where do we go oh The Miner mark one takes a portable iron plates and
52:10
concrete I don't have any concrete yeah I still got a little on me I got the concrete you got the
52:18
plates uh you can grab them from the uh the guy down there I'll pick
52:35
oh are why not just pick them up from the Constructor what are are
52:43
you oh you need plates sorry I thought that those were plates okay Miner and then I assume we
52:50
want to put it on that oh it just puts it locks into place y right over it yep
52:58
boom so now we need to power it and then we also need to link it up with the iron
53:05
smelter uhhuh so we need more
53:14
wires where's the power all the way up there e yeah and then we also need a uh
53:20
we can either connect directly to this guy this biomass one right here oh well
53:26
we're not using oh sure I plug it directly on there so we don't have to worry about it
53:32
sure and then we need uh
53:44
plates conveyors need what uh iron
53:50
plates oh oh you just make it
53:56
and then we just into there yeah you click it and then you click it
54:02
Y and now boom y dude factoral got nothing on
54:17
this backo can't do this the other thing the other thing we can do is uh build a storage container
54:30
uh okay so we have to hold the output of that so we can hold the output of the iron being uh taken
54:37
out where'd you go iron taken out so all this iron want a buff you can put a
54:43
buffer in here so it pulls in all the way through here and then it grabs into this guy because this one can only grab
54:49
up to 100 or and the minor yeah yeah but I mean what you
54:56
don't really need to buffer the The Ore CU we're not really using the ore for
55:02
anything right true that that is true I'm just saying that's something you can do like it'd be
55:08
better to buffer something like this but even this isn't really I got you um it's just something that we can't do that's
55:14
just something that I noticed okay um if you want to save power yeah is so how do we get like more
55:21
power like how do we get like like like better power cuz this whole thing is not
55:27
we got to upgrade the Hub we need uh we need biomass biomass yeah but like yeah
55:33
how do we get like like solar or whatever I don't know I didn't get that
55:40
far okay I just got to tier three and that's
55:46
just like the Bare Bones of it I guess I'll grab like more copper and Limestone I'm going to build a miner at
55:53
the Copper okay build like a mini a mini uh base over
56:05
there you don't want to conveyor it all the way back we we
56:10
could well I think we should we we
56:16
can solar use human pollution spewing power is all we
56:21
got that's not right
56:26
right I take do you take fall damage you can very little I mean my God that's
56:32
crazy it's just so like minimal it's like not even worth like thinking about
56:37
and then all the little uh fruits you can see you can pick them up and you can um yeah eat get health eat it
56:53
yeah I need concrete one of your power grids has
57:00
shut down oh no oh no we need more
57:08
biomass production has stopped there's some in the uh in the chests pull lever
57:14
to reset oh that's funny I'm sure that'll get annoying
57:20
really quick oh it does I'm sure that will get annoying very fast hey oh it
57:26
does
57:34
um I want to ask the guy in your chat what impure means but I also don't want
57:39
to know okay so I'm not going to look it up we won't know that's fine with
57:46
me I I've just noticed there's something with impure and normal sure it's perfectly fine yeah
57:54
we'll find out eventually that's no wor
58:01
about do the leaves grow back uh I don't
58:07
know but there's like so much of them so like it doesn't really
58:12
matter spoken like a true colonizer I don't know I'm just thinking back to my my
58:18
factorio gameplay now I've exhausted so many resources
58:26
don't worry once we get further into this game we can start automating things then we can start exploring oh oh oh I
58:32
found I found I found a blue shroom huh I found blue shroom in cave
58:40
oh pick up leaves have fun in there it's the amount the node gives you with a minor in on it
58:47
impure gives 30 per minute normal is 60 pure is 120 oh so impure sucks yeah we
58:54
have the sucky one there's another one behind the behind the house the behind
59:00
the the the the workshop yeah no no no the the Limestone wait what there's
59:06
another Limestone all the way back there I don't know how to Ping is there a ping button in this game oh I guess there is
59:11
one like kind of that way I a little more did you pick up the
59:17
Limestone uh cuz the miner had like barely in in it when I walk over there yeah yeah I picked up a couple from it
59:23
okay I needed it for the minor up here oh
59:31
then I need a uh yeah the planes has some of the
59:36
worst nodes on the map but great place for new players to learn how to play uhhuh wasn't that
59:42
nice how far can I do I have any cables on
59:49
me no
59:56
made the minor but I also don't have any uh any way to power
1:00:02
it we're just going to have to get a bunch of um power grid
1:00:07
items seems like a good game to fully comprehend how good factorio is what
1:00:14
I when I told my cooworker was a big factorio head I told him about satisfactory he's like satisfactory is
1:00:21
good it's just every time I play satisfactory I just want to play factorio so I put down satisfactory
1:00:35
I mean at least in this game you don't really have like like enemies that are trying to like kill you so far so far
1:00:41
you're right that I mean granted you can just turn it to peaceful mode in
1:00:47
factorio oh I don't know if you can do that in this one I'm just saying if that was your great about Factoria you can
1:00:56
[Music]
1:01:06
all right uh iron
1:01:14
Daniel wait
1:01:20
what all right so I have all the plates we need rods now yeah so you can just change the
1:01:25
production flow on that guy oh just change it to rods yeah uh
1:01:36
oh 15 per
1:01:42
minute what are you talking about right now I have so
1:01:48
little hard do it reach can I reach over there
1:01:53
huh I know in factorio you can have it snap I mean
1:01:59
oh wait is it connected it's connect no it looks like it's oh I see no it's his wire is too long yeah so bring it bring
1:02:05
it to the max distance and then you should be able to connect it from there to the there you go right there and then boom boom all right so now we just need
1:02:13
a giant conveyor belt well now we just need a lot of conveyor belts the dunes location has the best
1:02:20
assortment of nodes but lacks biomass and doesn't have a lot of flat areas to build on the ground all right ah
1:02:26
so should we I mean I we could pivot off the Hub and just start working on
1:02:35
the oh my God these rods are going to take forever uhhuh
1:02:43
Jesus what's the purpose of a conveyor pole Mr Silver
1:02:52
Wing what's the I I know I can lift it up and down but like really what is the point just for like
1:03:05
adjustments make things pretty looking make them all pretty I think it's I think it's all
1:03:13
Aesthetics this game's a bunch of nonsense all pretty stuff bun Aesthetics
1:03:20
see factorio is just ugly nothing pretty about that game doesn't have to it just gets
1:03:30
uglier complete the offboarding process upgrade six Landing platform Hydraulics
1:03:36
completed freighter Landing initial don't worry I'm almost there congratulations 34 more iron onard and
1:03:42
achieve the absolute minimum absolute minimum skill level there we go
1:03:48
oh future achievements because a future with fix it as a future with you tier
1:03:53
one and two Milestones are now available able in the hub and biomass burners can now be built
1:03:59
individually your first official objective is to initiate project assembly by building the space elevator
1:04:05
space elevator this objective will take a significant amount of resources so fix
1:04:10
bi we can build more but that isn't that's not really my problem right now I don't think we can make biomass we can
1:04:17
make biomass yeah yeah with the
1:04:22
leaves oh okay makes them way better oh okay okay so we should probably make that right now then yeah probably take
1:04:28
him out from the uh oh hell
1:04:35
yeah oh hell yeah uh he said to end a belt uh to end
1:04:42
the belt with so you can make nice neat belt
1:04:47
turns biomass can also be automated yeah biomask can also be automated I just haven't found a nice
1:04:54
way to make it auto how do you how do you collect yeah how do you collect the how do you collect things automatedly I
1:04:59
don't know how do you collect the biomass that that's the part I don't
1:05:04
understand how do you like make that automated so our main objective is the space elevator yeah so we can so we're done
1:05:12
with tier zero so it's time for tier one uh do you want to do Base building
1:05:19
legistics or field research we don't Base
1:05:27
building let's see Logistics seems like it's more like conveyor stuff yeah and field research is also
1:05:34
really good too cuz it gives us the map we don't need Base building I mean I'd
1:05:39
love some Base building wrong but I mean eventually but like not now are we uh what's the deal on the
1:05:46
conveyor belts I'm almost done I I oh
1:05:52
well sorry I take your flow there I was almost done I need a iron sorry Perfect
1:05:59
Look at that nice production FL that nice yep all the way from Ground Zero
1:06:04
over there all right let's start working on biomass I
1:06:09
guess I'm going to get my other minor and put it down with your uh the other one over here so you can also choose
1:06:17
from tier two if you want um that's true but I'm kind of a tier one kind of guy
1:06:23
right now you know I don't like to I Don't Like Jump Ahead you know this is the most Jank looking no I
1:06:30
like it I like it I like this is standard I'm not saying no I'm not
1:06:36
saying it's a bad thing I don't have this but it's so much better I should have I should have done this in mine oh
1:06:42
you didn't do this in yours no I've been running back and forth trying to get the
1:06:47
stuff all right so by so let's see we need a Constructor again yeah let me
1:06:54
make some cables I'll work on making the uh the
1:07:00
plates okay uh all right where do we want the
1:07:07
Constructor I assume just next to one of the other ones kind of in line in line in front of the other one
1:07:17
yeah oh I'm missing what what I missing place you need um like what the [ __ ]
1:07:24
reinforce iron plates is that more is that more than the regular plates is
1:07:30
that like you need screws oh I got it or do you want to make it uh you make
1:07:37
it you make it all right I'll make biomass damn lot of
1:07:52
screws get these leaves out of here oh [ __ ] the fuse is blown no that's me
1:07:59
that's me oh replacing the
1:08:06
power with biomass
1:08:11
uh I'm going to do us just just just to keep things lined up I'm going to make
1:08:17
oh wait a second this Constructor is not lined up with the other I see now that it's not lined up
1:08:25
all right yeah it is well I'm just going to [ __ ] place it wherever then CU it just lined up no it's not it's a
1:08:32
skew it's it's lined up are they just oh the Constructor is
1:08:38
just wider yeah it's lined up oh man when you're placing it down when you're
1:08:43
placing it down you can sometimes see like a little line that forms yeah and you can like line it up that
1:08:51
way there you go uh we could move this guy
1:08:57
over it line it up there holding left control when placing two a line
1:09:06
what that's what he said really that's what he said I'm just the messenger man don't shoot
1:09:12
me oh oh my oh wow is that like a cracked uh
1:09:19
that's like game changing really ni see wait how do I how do I get my is it in
1:09:24
my invent you got you got to build it back up oh oh it deconstructs us into P
1:09:30
yeah oh dude that's crazy that's I know I I know oh does it lock to both
1:09:37
too like both axes uh-huh that's wild that's kind of
1:09:48
crazy what is what is this oh I broke I need why did you throw a smelter in front of us I moved the smelter that was
1:09:55
over here oh for like the aligning stuff yeah I also broke the compar ball so I
1:10:02
don't have enough concrete oh um do mayhaps uh what do you need finish
1:10:10
I need I don't have enough stuff for the concrete what what do you oh
1:10:16
concrete oh I don't have I can make I can make five concrete I'll make some I
1:10:21
think I have I have six concrete what I don't have any Concrete On Me uh put in the chest real
1:10:28
quick and I can build the rest of the the conveyor conveyor takes
1:10:35
concrete what the [ __ ] happened to the conveyor I took it apart oh so I can
1:10:42
realign ah
1:11:00
there we go and then I P my copper there and then we need wires to this
1:11:06
guy and then actually uh let's get this
1:11:23
wire h
1:11:32
oh cuz like different elevation yeah we could build uh
1:11:38
platforms yeah How We Do That Base building son of a
1:11:44
[ __ ] I mean you can go back and do Base building instead of legistics we haven't put anything in
1:11:52
yeah let's do that so we can get platforms oh my God that's so much concrete oh my God all right let's make
1:11:58
another Miner hey Veron what do we need for the of course
1:12:06
you need concrete to make the thing that going to mine the concrete you bring some
1:12:16
over I'll put him in the chest you make half I make
1:12:22
half yeah I'm going to go make the limestone minor right now here we go um do you want to make it
1:12:30
in that one over here I didn't look at there's a ping button any resources you add to a
1:12:37
milestone will stay with that Milestone should you switch to a new one oh so good thing we didn't put anything on
1:12:42
there he's what we didn't put anything on the uh but he just he just said that
1:12:48
it doesn't matter if we do any resist it will stay with the Milestone
1:12:54
so you we go back to it it's fine yeah but like I'm saying like if we put something in the other Milestone then we
1:13:01
can't like take it out swap we can't take it out okay I'm going to pick up the miner from the Limestone did you put oh you put two miners in the Limestone
1:13:08
yeah kind ofart get everything I had an extra I think this one over here kind of
1:13:14
guy oh this guy figured out out of ping how you how do you ping uh
1:13:20
alt this guy's a liar alt and click
1:13:26
all right that checks out all right these are both
1:13:32
impure now that we know what that word
1:13:38
means uh oh I got to build so many things what do you got to
1:13:44
build oh actually maybe I
1:13:53
don't uh
1:14:03
um I'm tell you right now this is how I made the 200
1:14:08
concretes I just sat down and just held one button oh is this thing
1:14:15
wait sir give me up wait what what oh I
1:14:22
see that oh oh so use this one over here uh
1:14:29
ping use that one since it has an open Line oh okay you can probably take apart this
1:14:38
one you can probably reach
1:14:44
right fantastic okay and now
1:14:51
conveyors okay you you can make him go up what uh
1:14:57
the conveyor
1:15:03
poles we just need uh plates or thats you like like that's not
1:15:10
what I meant but okay that was that what you meant that's not what I meant uh I
1:15:16
need uh rods me show you holding while moving let you run
1:15:23
while holding C to slide what what what they're sliding I know they're
1:15:30
sliding my God there's dolphin diving oh dude and
1:15:36
you [ __ ] move look at me go oh dude this is
1:15:46
crazy man I've been I've been slacking yeah we've been we've been messing
1:15:51
around see this is why we need someone like this guy okay that's a plus letter I'll I'll get back I'll give this game
1:15:57
that at least all right all right um Jesus dude you move so quick like you
1:16:05
move okay what was I working oh yeah the conveyor here let me show you the let me show you this uh this thing that I does
1:16:11
the Constructor so the the furnace is for smelting but the Constructor will make it from like Limestone to concrete
1:16:18
yeah what going to do you can do this you can pull it up
1:16:25
how do you do that using the uh the conveyor pole the
1:16:31
conveyor pole number four number four oh so click and drag
1:16:43
up what if I want it bigger than that uh two pads so
1:16:50
side okay oh yeah Constructor so uh are you going to leave it like what
1:16:58
yeah what okay I
1:17:05
think do I have enough stuff for the Constructor no I need some
1:17:10
wires uh we might need to build another biomass
1:17:16
burner you can slide under the belts really no way no way can I can I
1:17:23
connect it to this this oh I bet I bet I can't cuz we need
1:17:28
the platform all right we're just going
1:17:46
to I wish there was a way to like um have like a crafting thing on you at all
1:17:53
times uh yeah that' be maybe there is so I don't have to keep running back
1:17:59
and forth to like what's up I'm out of mine he says you can slide under the
1:18:06
belts yeah oh my God I are you kidding
1:18:20
me this is hype this is pretty crazy all right
1:18:50
what is that
1:18:59
oh storage's gigantic I guess that kind of makes
1:19:12
sense what do the different colors mean what different
1:19:18
colors like this one's yellow whereas that one's
1:19:23
green I think it means it's not being used it's inactive oh that's someone didn't
1:19:30
connect the cables together oh and this is invalid shape oh
1:19:36
we got to move
1:19:49
this what on Earth is going on why won't it in valid shap oh you built it
1:19:55
backwards no that doesn't sound like
1:20:01
me you can have buildings to your hot bar what you what you can add buildings
1:20:10
to your hot bar by hovering your mouse over menu pressing the ash the number
1:20:15
you want get 10 hot bars oh that's kind of crazy a man I feel like an idiot
1:20:25
the more I play this game the more he tells me these things I'm like wow smarter that's I wish I was
1:20:32
smarter 10 hot bars I wonder what other game does
1:20:37
that oh Daniel don't don't look up is he going to is he going to destroy
1:20:48
everything why is he running I tased him oh I told him get out
1:20:56
Daniel Daniel the is Do We R out of power we ran out of power one of
1:21:02
them Daniel we're running out of power I'm making more biomask give me a second
1:21:07
can I can I switch the I mean I guess controls whatever all
1:21:14
right so the reason why it it's broken is because there's too many things connected to it right
1:21:21
now so we have to disconnect uh this guy oh uh build another one of
1:21:29
these poles and connect to the other biomass one and then connect it to the other one
1:21:35
yeah this is getting
1:21:43
intricate let's put this one right next to this one cuz that's the smart thing to do
1:21:50
right yep it keeps things very simple
1:21:55
uh let's get rid of this one this guy into there this guy into that
1:22:03
boom Oh and then this guy into here there we
1:22:09
go power back on wow you're so smart
1:22:17
Daniel that solution will only work for so long you're so smart until we need to
1:22:22
uh build more biomass
1:22:28
all right what are we doing uh plates we need
1:22:35
plates and then we need uh rods I'm trying to see if I can I'm
1:22:42
trying to see if I can slide up the conveyor
1:22:52
belts the sliming is so much
1:23:01
fun seems you lack this yeah sliding up does not really seem to
1:23:07
be who what no I got
1:23:15
like [ __ ] oh I should probably just make oh I like this skill
1:23:21
huh dude it I'm telling you you just can't do it you have any rods on do you have any iron on you you can just start smelting
1:23:28
it or crafting it to get rid of it out of your inventory yeah was
1:23:39
like oh man bels can be used as airport walkways to speed up movement that makes
1:23:47
sense what do we need oh just for the rods yeah I don't have that much on me I
1:23:53
have like a ton on me me for some reason oh I have a lot of ingots make the make the um things what
1:24:00
the rods the rods yeah yeah the rods aren't really our problem though it's the
1:24:06
concrete that's coming yeah it's taking a little
1:24:11
while you should build every belt with a minimum obuse angle that allows upward sliding
1:24:25
is that all your rods there yeah I put all my rods in
1:24:31
there only 33 why is it so slow I I picked up some of them but it's
1:24:38
still not enough how much do you have
1:24:49
that you have the other Miner yeah you want to put it on the other one back there
1:24:59
I also got to show you
1:25:06
something come this way whenever you
1:25:27
I'm the same thing you are I want to turn around and see if you're doing the same thing all right uh
1:25:33
you what's up with that like you do that do
1:25:40
what yeah you be doing that uh doing what the
1:25:53
grunting no no way no way my game
1:25:59
froze this my game froze I don't know what's happening you know right now what's
1:26:05
happening damn it my my game literally oh hello as soon
1:26:11
as I stopped doing it hold on I I think I hold on let me let me get back up
1:26:17
there I fell down the cliff I do
1:26:22
it yes that that was the thing do I take fall damage oh little I
1:26:30
do all right where are you I'm back on the mountain what did you want to see I'm down here go down there
1:26:42
yeah see you flying in the air boom fall I TR I slide with it so you hear
1:26:51
the music yeah we driving see how it's like see how it's changing when you get over
1:26:56
here yeah I will pick that up blue Power
1:27:05
slug why he's so like shill oh I
1:27:16
fell SL okay well again
1:27:25
do I have to pick him up he's so cool you can leave him I'm just saying that he's up there and it's something cool we can grab there's going to be a lot more
1:27:31
of him God damn it okay we'll leave him up there
1:27:38
obviously obviously the Lord wants us to leave him
1:27:44
alone didn't know you would chill like that I grab some more from the uh
1:27:54
this guy
1:27:59
49 when are you at I'm making some right now from the other [Music]
1:28:06
guy we need 30 we need 22 I have 17 take it to
1:28:14
leave leave it all right I'll go back to the uh any
1:28:22
gu five more
1:28:32
I got nine you got nine
1:28:42
cool you want to do the honors of go for it go for it of
1:28:47
what what is the honors press the button oh [ __ ] and then come outside as fast as
1:28:54
you can and look up Milestone reached several new
1:29:01
structures are now available for improving Factory organization foundations provide a building grid
1:29:07
which makes it easier to manage placement of any structure in the event that you are experiencing amnesia for
1:29:13
all events prior to Planet fall be reassured that memories of beloved humans and or animals would have only
1:29:20
been distractions from your important Mission oh and it comes back in minute with with our stuff is it uh no with uh
1:29:29
so we can do next one um can we where what
1:29:37
what oh what are you confused about I don't know why he left I thought I thought all that was to give
1:29:44
us like we got it where's he going space
1:29:50
why to deliver the products that we just made concrete the rods I thought all of
1:29:55
that was used as like research to make the pods well yeah they they trade you
1:30:01
know they trade we give them resources we give them resources and they give us technology all right so we can make some
1:30:06
foundations now oh of course it needs concrete yeah it need some butload of
1:30:12
concrete man all right I'm next some
1:30:19
platforms is that what we doing
1:30:27
I need I'm focus on the
1:30:34
uh the uh next challenge sure
1:30:41
man oh he's back he's back wait he's he's back he's
1:30:47
back do we do we get anything from him congrats on your first offering to
1:30:52
the sky Gods yeah
1:30:58
Freer re-entry Milestone exchange concluded I didn't read the rest of when
1:31:03
placing Foundation holding left control will lock it to the world Bridge so no matter
1:31:09
where you build the foundations will always line up that is
1:31:14
phenomenal the the left control button thing was insane that's a crazy tip
1:31:21
oh why why is the world diag no we build diagonal we bu
1:31:38
no I'm almost done with the uh with the
1:31:45
challenge now this is interesting now why would it let me do this Ryan do you like Ramen I like Ramen Ryan do you like
1:31:51
Ramen I got a noodle stopper figure from round one you want want
1:31:56
it what hun Miku Fu Ryu noodle stopper figurine love
1:32:05
Blazer Vocaloid Japan I don't understand what does it
1:32:10
doe Z and Z up down noodle stopper what is what is a noodle
1:32:16
stopper what does that mean what do you mean by zp
1:32:25
foundations you can zo him r r zo Daniel the power
1:32:33
grid what is
1:32:39
zo vertical what's I'm so confused what is zo why is it like
1:32:46
turning did you read the the the the zo comment
1:32:52
zo no Z there are three ways to place
1:32:57
foundations pressing R will cycle through them first placement zop and Z up down yeah what the hell is zp mode
1:33:06
what is z did you just finish that Dam Milestone reached conveyor belts can now merge split and LIF save space and
1:33:14
enhance the productivity of your factory build mode fix it encourages you to consider investing in verticality when
1:33:20
it comes to factory Logistics you feel stressed by complexity imagine yourself on the shore
1:33:26
of a vast and calm ocean breathe in visualize all the people relying on the
1:33:32
sea is made of billions of faces each staring at you with hope and Tears in their eyes found Breathe Out Feel
1:33:39
refreshed and focused on your duties I think Z lets you build like a
1:33:46
lot
1:33:54
what was the
1:34:09
was Ryan I'm getting lazy what I'm getting lazy what do you
1:34:15
mean it's time to build more Constructors I look at what I made I made these like boxes that we can stand
1:34:22
on see aren't these really cool they can like slide on them and stuff you should
1:34:27
have built the uh the lookout tower the lookout tower the lookout tower so you can look over our
1:34:36
Workshop I need rods the The Constructor is building
1:34:41
rods I think which one the Constructor the iron one yeah
1:34:58
I'm getting lazy can you carry me to bed all right I'm getting lazy can we
1:35:03
another Constructor yeah do you want to start building them on these platforms or what do we want to
1:35:09
do yeah start I mean that was kind of the reason we spent all that time Daniel
1:35:15
the fuse is blown H yeah yeah yeah
1:35:28
check out the space elevator hologram oh yeah it's crazy go on the
1:35:34
space Tower go go on the go on the lookout tower it's
1:35:45
wild holy crap Lois that's gigantic what is this
1:35:51
forend to send stuff to the uh
1:36:00
okay oh I saw I'm having some riveting uh stream gameplay right now what on your end or
1:36:08
on my end on my end all I'm doing is just holding the
1:36:14
craft button I'm trying to get up on top of the
1:36:20
uh parkour I'm trying to get up on H I feel like you can but it's definitely a
1:36:33
tricky uhoh uhoh uh I guess I should make some more
1:36:39
platforms then if you want to start moving the
1:36:44
stuff over to the platforms that'd be fantastic why are you not like locking
1:36:50
with the other [ __ ]
1:37:01
oh wait how do we like what's up with these like
1:37:08
rocks Silver Wing what's up with the Rocks like the Box the
1:37:13
Rocks you see it's like rock what about it it's like in the
1:37:19
way I can't like break it
1:37:25
he you what I'm saying speaking of elevator there are buildable items that assist with
1:37:34
rapid it's not
1:37:48
working back to back to some more riveting gameplay for me
1:37:53
holding left click there's a method to remove them but you're not there yet all right you don't need to make fun of
1:38:01
me oh I see what's happening I see the issue there's like
1:38:08
different this game is like so just
1:38:21
complex it's making it hard to just like play just like Minecraft you know
1:38:28
mhm you should go on Zoot mode I'm on Zoot mode it's it's it's it's not for the faint of
1:38:33
heart z z go crazy it's it's tough the angle to your foundation is because you
1:38:40
turned them what I didn't I didn't turn these you said hold on let's go over
1:38:47
here I I snapped them look that that's just how it snaps I think he's talking about our
1:38:55
buildings I think our buildings are uh yeah cuz if you look straight at the
1:39:02
the compass South is this direction oh you're right yeah our buildings are
1:39:10
crooked weird who would have thought I would
1:39:20
have what what are you working on now field research for tier one yeah I'm
1:39:26
almost done I'm just Wai on the
1:39:34
copper you want to start moving this stuff on top of the platforms that be fantastic yeah would that be would that
1:39:39
be helpful that'd be that'd be really cool all right um are we are we going to move our Hub
1:39:46
or is our Hub kind of locked in here we can move our hub no way oh [ __ ] we can
1:39:53
that's
1:39:59
crazy Jesus Bryant with the [ __ ] gifted sub thank you Bryant
1:40:06
wow a foundation H place a hologram buy a foundation and mouse
1:40:16
wheeler what place a holog found place a holog what does it mean place a holog
1:40:23
like if you press the H remember when I told you or whatever oh okay and then
1:40:29
place a foundation underneath it place a hologram buy a foundation and
1:40:36
mouse feel it f what f
1:40:42
f no no I don't think it's F I think that's just them saying f as in uh we're
1:40:48
really far oh
1:40:54
no Phoenix you can't spoil
1:41:03
it oh you just finished tier one dude he did it Milestone reached Supply
1:41:10
the molecular analysis machine referred to as the M with local resources to research and develop new
1:41:16
technologies potential Technologies include exploration tools weapons and
1:41:21
Factory buildings these are essential for maximizing your Pioneer efficiency in alignment with fix its core pillars
1:41:28
construct automate explore and exploit to advance fix its Mission all notable
1:41:34
phenomena resources technology or other influence should be investigated regardless of any perceived danger as
1:41:41
stated in the pioner contract to the foundations you placed and place a foundation Hollow if it's still crooked
1:41:47
use mouseful
1:42:11
hey hey
1:42:28
all right what do you want to move you want to get the uh you want to get that guy up here yeah probably concrete may get some
1:42:35
more all right let's
1:42:41
um I need a lot more concrete and a lot more
1:42:47
rods what oh not
1:43:05
you he so mad he doesn't get the don't place it Mouse wheel can turn
1:43:10
Foundation
1:43:19
90° I don't think silver ring understands how much of uh idiots we are this guy's got like way
1:43:27
too high of hopes he has real high
1:43:33
IQ us not so much why you so [ __ ]
1:43:43
big oh you just can't you just can't
1:43:49
be all right
1:43:54
all
1:44:13
right all right so so Ryan yo I think our iron production is slow
1:44:23
um okay that's just you
1:44:31
but um I definely want to make another furnace
1:44:36
hey I have the resources for that
1:44:47
too and then we need another Constructor
1:44:54
yeah that's good that was just what I was thinking split up the
1:45:01
[Music] iron contractors take up an entire Foundation that checks
1:45:17
out why are you yelling at me what's the problem I don't have those
1:45:39
[Music] oh why' you move them so far away from
1:45:45
each other what the Constructor and the uh that was
1:45:51
that was the furthest I could put them with out like if cuz the The Constructor wouldn't get exactly here like it
1:45:57
wouldn't it wouldn't touch it kept like getting it kept yelling at me like it wouldn't do it oh you can give it a try
1:46:05
um nah I'll Pro like I'll try it again like like it's yelling at me saying like
1:46:10
it won't place on say it's too close yeah it's saying it's too close even when I'm just like yeah I don't know I
1:46:17
sared
1:46:31
right I know you're learning at all but could you do something to elevate the newer experience Fenix you know how this goes you've seen me play
1:46:41
factorio all great I mean ideally we should put this this guy on in the
1:46:47
middle what here what the splitter yeah got to move it well we we can also move
1:46:54
the Hub you want to move the Hub right now uh we move it we can move it like like there and then have it face like
1:47:00
this way go for it all
1:47:07
right our
1:47:20
power all right yep
1:47:28
uh then you are powered on to which one this guy
1:47:35
Oh wait [ __ ] sorry got to SM it again what it was it was a [ __ ] the
1:47:42
wrong way there
1:48:00
everything starts with The Miner and how much it gives set it
1:48:08
right um You have the cables in the biofuel oh you're you're so
1:48:16
right um biofuel there's some copper
1:48:23
you're hoarding
1:48:40
[ __ ] we got power moving I'd mov that workbench somewhere
1:48:47
else honestly I move it closer oh oh I I I just wanted to have one at the house
1:48:54
well there is one over here well I me like
1:49:06
two right I need another cable but you have them they're in the chest all of them uh some I got it
1:49:26
probably going to need another biofuel heads up my heads
1:49:32
up build another biofuel biomass
1:49:41
burner they're reworking ciban you get him for free if you log into Warframe I
1:49:46
don't know who that is who the [ __ ] is calan
1:49:54
I need copper and I need plates
1:50:24
how the [ __ ] do you rotate this thing that's real hey I'm I'm I promise
1:50:30
you oh there it is you
1:50:38
zoing oh he's zing
1:51:00
uh if you want to move this guy now we can over I'm working on getting us another burner
1:51:08
can't it's a frame you can get for free but I don't Fenix I wouldn't I don't
1:51:13
play the game
1:51:26
what is it it's uh Logistics conveyor Bel splitter logic
1:51:33
yeah a splitter oh I see orange is the input we might want to we might want to put in
1:51:38
the middle yeah if we're going to have maybe three in the future oh do you think we're going to have three yeah I
1:51:45
guess that does check we're going to need three maybe four even now this guy's
1:51:52
[ __ ]
1:51:59
greedy is that is that too little room oh it's
1:52:12
not why do you do that that's so ugly also if you hold left control and use
1:52:18
Mouse wheel when placing you can rotate the foundation 18 times for a full 180° so you can turn all these squares into a
1:52:26
circle what I'm just going to have to trust you
1:52:33
for now how do I make the what was what was the thing to make the conveyor belts nicer
1:52:39
looking what happened how do you make the Cav belts nicer like have them like actually this is this is not nice enough
1:52:44
for you you see this angle here this sharp ass yeah this is not nice kind ofy
1:52:50
this is not nice I'm anti this you need the uh number four the conveyor
1:52:59
pole start from the
1:53:07
smelter yeah so like then then then click down where you want it and then it
1:53:24
uh what was I making
1:53:32
concrete the beginning this looks prettier I guess still not in love but
1:53:41
it's well I can do this
1:53:57
now look like an actual
1:54:20
Junction where where are you
1:54:26
all right I'll let you figure that out fing don't worry say you are sh many
1:54:35
rods I have 43 rods on me what do you need
1:54:43
uh none I just made it
1:55:02
uh belt
1:55:13
PS oh the
1:55:20
concrete uh two like they make concrete never mind
1:55:53
oh
1:56:01
yeah have you ever for a moment considered buying the funky rat 7even mouse I have no idea what that
1:56:07
is where you going Dan I need concrete oh all
1:56:13
right get you on the flippity
1:56:35
interesting interesting approach
1:56:50
here what are you working on now sorry I was checking out disc I'm not really doing anything
1:56:56
um as is how my normal factoral gaming goes what you're not constantly moving
1:57:03
constantly no I usually just sit around for a while just thinking about things
1:57:10
ah um let me get some of these
1:57:17
[Music] going you build another con
1:57:29
there if anything we can even shift everything back shift everything
1:57:37
back yeah what you mean like move it Clos to the edge where
1:57:42
the last couple of things are what where the the tower is right over here
1:57:56
right here oh like pull those back oh yeah yeah yeah for sure I was just
1:58:03
making uh
1:58:22
who is connected to
1:58:29
what eventually we can even color code uh some of the uh
1:58:34
buildings so you can tell what's connected to what
1:58:55
uh look you [Music]
1:59:09
guys
1:59:14
what what did I just disconnect something isn't running but I don't know what
1:59:24
that that about checks out with what I'm doing right what are you doing I'm trying to
1:59:29
move everything ah whatever I'll Milestone reach solid biofuel created from any biomass ensures maximum
1:59:36
efficiency of biomass burners what's off to Aid in biofuel production the chainsaw allows for the removal of
1:59:43
tougher wood and coral foliage additionally your pocket Dimension has been inflated to increase inventory size
1:59:50
inspirational note will you be the fixed employee of the month you could be if
1:59:56
you construct automate explore and exploit by eliminating all obstacles to
2:00:01
efficiency this isn't just fun it's contractually mandated fun fun fun oh
2:00:06
Lanes in my chat no way hey Lane nice of you to join this stream oh
2:00:14
she can't hear me well I'm glad she's here for this nice riveting gameplay button
2:00:24
I'm not I know which one connected to what no empty power line connections
2:00:33
oh were you connected to like this guy maybe that's how it works all right and then this is out
2:00:38
of juice here I got some yeah I'm out here
2:00:44
so so what is this thing doing that's another one why is it
2:00:50
gigantic it's the same size as these guys why are you lying to no it's about the same you
2:00:57
are lying right through your te why are you lying why would I lie
2:01:03
I why would I why would I lie to you I mean I'll give it to you they look the same internally but they are not the
2:01:10
same externally is it because these are a part of the Hub and this is a standalone H you got it wow that's
2:01:20
awesome I too too lazy to build this on my own so I'm going to use this guy over
2:01:31
here that's good it still goes goes through that that's
2:01:45
good my hand is like
2:02:02
what did that look like it looks like you were uh yeah [Laughter]
2:02:10
yep one of these one of
2:02:16
these nice he look look at this look at this look at this
2:02:33
oh we don't have any we don't have any uh thing we're working on you've been playing for 2 hours oh
2:02:41
man uh what do we want to do next
2:02:46
um I'm working on energy don't worry any Logistics yeah why not
2:02:53
you can no longer refund the game that's a good point I have had the game for like a
2:02:58
year and a half so could do it
2:03:05
anyway um oh yeah can't we like buy we like build things now to like remove foliage is that the whole reason we
2:03:11
still last Milestone yeah Shaina oh wow that is so
2:03:19
expensive I don't even know what half of those things are 20 15 wires a bunch of
2:03:31
rods is it a reinforced plate I actually can't tell what that is
2:03:39
it wants five reinforced plates oh and 160
2:03:44
screws yeah that's like what uh 40 40 um
2:03:54
did I do that math right one makes
2:03:59
four so 40 makes
2:04:05
160 uh screws or whatever they call the
2:04:10
things you know H one of those you know one of those something like that can't
2:04:18
math not a math major no I didn't go to school for that nope wasn't
2:04:25
me wait no you were the you were the math guy that was not the math you the math guy no you always were like ah and
2:04:33
I was always like yeah not math you can lie to the audience you can
2:04:40
lie to your mother but why is this production so slow oh
2:04:45
why why are you putting into okay what no no I'm just what
2:04:51
you're doing oh making a chainsaw ah y
2:04:57
uh we need to make an assembly soon soon yeah
2:05:04
why it's going to help us make things like uh like reinforced
2:05:13
plates and uh what else I need to make the
2:05:23
the ma'am all right I got a chainsaw switch to single
2:05:31
mode area mode yeah single mode okay where is that
2:05:36
tree hey John how do I that what's the
2:05:44
key you pinging me right now drop it drop it I I don't know where the key is What is the key
2:05:52
so I don't know there's no I like to rev it up there's no key it's just highlights huh
2:06:00
rev rev it how do you rev fuel get have fuel oh
2:06:08
wait does it need fuel I mean a chainsaw needs fuel it
2:06:13
says it needs wood do you have any wood uh no probably had some wood
2:06:19
earlier I made it on the B yeah we got we have 54
2:06:24
wood why would a chainsaw require wood I don't I don't know needs fuel how do you
2:06:30
put the fuel
2:06:36
in make sure you don't need uh dude I I'm I'm not sure of anything bof fuel it
2:06:44
says wood but I don't know how to give it the wood do I need to like place the wood I
2:06:50
don't know how to give it the wood
2:06:59
uh no one in chat is answering I didn't really ask a question how do I well yes I have been asking a
2:07:04
question how do I give it wood I give it
2:07:10
wood biofuel plus r biofuel
2:07:18
R it h no it says wood it has has to be biofuel specifically
2:07:25
biofuel yeah don't don't say yeah yeah
2:07:30
Oh I thought that was wood that's what I asked you
2:07:35
oh I I had more in there wait so damn
2:07:41
you got any I I I just put some in there where got in the fire bur oh how do I
2:07:49
take like uh right click it should split it in half
2:07:55
yeah oh ooh
2:08:02
reev oh how how much wood you get
2:08:07
nine there's a rock somewhere too isn't there where's that rock at I don't think you can cut down a rock with a
2:08:16
chaina no way I got to be able to dang
2:08:26
oh my hand yeah you can't get the Rocks
2:08:32
um well that was awesome really good use of all those resources for the
2:08:38
chainsaw um all right what are what what are we doing what do I need to be doing
2:08:44
um we need a way to make screw make what
2:08:49
screws so if you can yeah yeah oh uh I mean we can move this back I guess if you build another Constructor we can
2:08:56
feed the the rods into uh inter Constructor and then make screws out of
2:09:02
that make screws all right
2:09:08
yeah you've been playing for 2 hours yeah that's what I just
2:09:14
got what did you get that too I just got it yeah oh I guess that I was on the world
2:09:20
for like 6 minutes earlier than you
2:09:37
were make it now yep
2:09:54
right these guys is that
2:10:01
right yeah
2:10:19
okay more concrete
2:10:24
uh whenever you get a second come back over to the main base I built something that I want you to look
2:10:32
at what's up oh the M the
2:10:38
maam what does it do check it out alien mega fauna
2:10:45
oh oh I see all the Hogs I we didn't kill any but yeah and oh
2:10:53
I see okay well I actually have the I have the hog so should I do the hog
2:10:59
research yeah do
2:11:05
it analysis complete analysis of hog research completed please choose a new node in a tree to begin
2:11:11
analysis oh what's up the remains researched belong to an organism now dubbed The
2:11:18
Fluffy tailed hog it has many character characteristics that would likely classify it among the sui family were it
2:11:25
native to Earth hog remains can now be made into alien protein and additional
2:11:30
research May reveal options for improving Pioneer safety during
2:11:37
exploration all right yeah yeah so now we've unlocked bioorganic
2:11:43
properties no we can now craft that but we need more Pro so
2:11:51
with the with the hog we've unlocked alien protein I think right so we can
2:11:56
make alien protein which then we can use for the next thing correct okay now now
2:12:03
go pick up that slug that I pointed out ear no he's so chill all right then pick up the one
2:12:08
that's up there all right yeah yeah but he's even Shiller look at him he's like way up
2:12:15
there wait wait you want to come you want to come uh all right no I don't want to pick either do I have to pick oh
2:12:21
we could pick a different one we can find another one yeah let's find another one how do we find uh we just look around all right we explore pick up it
2:12:29
which way do you want to head out uh should we go separately or should we go together n let's go together okay here
2:12:35
come follow me you check out the cave to while you're over
2:12:44
here you can just hold it you can just hold it down oh
2:12:49
[ __ ] this is cool you think my sh unauthorized
2:12:56
hostility towards Pioneers detected all right all right all right my
2:13:01
bad yeah bring it bring it bring it
2:13:07
Punk oh D we can totally put this in ma'am samples of unknown alien species
2:13:14
put in data suggests these are predators but notably they do not have a traditional mouth or eyes there are
2:13:21
however numerous similar function yeah let's get it research the remains in the m to
2:13:28
establish classification and potential counter measures summer Sloop I don't know man you sure we should get this
2:13:33
this is one of those like things you know dude it's the S it's it's the Superman s I'm picking it up
2:13:40
no oh God oh God the summer Sloop was named after Marie Somerville co-founder
2:13:46
of Fixit and head of its R&D Department there are many theories about the origin
2:13:51
of this shape and why this symbol mathematically resembling a Mobius strip has found its way to both human and
2:13:57
extraterrestrial culture thankfully you don't need to know any of these theories to be a Pioneer research it in the m to
2:14:05
establish locally appropriate classification and application fun fact
2:14:10
the planet you are on was found and named during a planet spotting event Marie hosted named awesome scientific
2:14:17
search of the avantgard exoplanets where's your like can you prove to us you know how to draw the
2:14:24
S the fruit of this fungus like Flora does not seem to show much potential for
2:14:29
use however myal network is worth further investigation research it in the
2:14:35
map there's a waterfall over there and potential application where
2:14:41
uh oh wait come here come here come
2:14:47
here you can pet him what he's running
2:15:00
away he's cute makes cute noises can we get
2:15:12
him this is it really funny you can still pet him when that's
2:15:19
a little that's a little sad all right over here yeah what's over
2:15:26
there a slug but that's the that's that's the cool guy slug that's not I don't think that's a chill one no it's
2:15:32
neither of the chillers what is this is iron yeah it's
2:15:38
iron this guy kills dogs it's not like that oh yeah this guy is not chill at
2:15:44
all this guy's just like gra him yeah I got him okay stop me come
2:15:53
on it's it's like stopping
2:15:59
me are you doing something it keeps like stopping it like 80% of the way
2:16:07
through what the [ __ ] was that I don't why take species seems to I couldn't Pi
2:16:13
it up absorbing and storing energy from its surroundings studying this could provide new methods for improving Fixit
2:16:20
production line efficiency uh let's go research it classification and potential
2:16:35
application potential edible collected eating it and surviving does not count as a valid field test and does not
2:16:42
generate enough data for fix it to make an informed decision research it in the m to establish classification and
2:16:49
potential application [Music] the [ __ ]
2:16:55
[ __ ] [ __ ]
2:17:02
you [ __ ] all right get up here I half Health now because of that loser I found another
2:17:13
slug up trying on top of this mountain
2:17:26
[Music] uh I got this slug not not sure if I can oh
2:17:34
heavens oh I found a found some gold or
2:17:41
cerium [Music] up unknown metal collected this metallic
2:17:47
element is showing properties similar to those in group 11 on the periodic table such as high conductivity and
2:17:54
malleability you research it in to establish classification and potential
2:18:01
application you get the slug N I got my wayb I just see him flopping around give
2:18:08
me your give me your bones or whatever no I think it's back here oh you're so
2:18:19
right I was able to get that one gather a power slug the yoink
2:18:26
achievement oh did you did you get up there yeah did you pick up the thing or no no I'm waiting for you I already
2:18:32
picked up one of these before oh it's cooler when you pick it
2:18:38
up
2:18:44
uh how did you get up here you pinging the way up yeah
2:18:52
yeah look at him big head walking by getting stuck mining
2:19:00
[Music] Limestone
2:19:06
uh okay oh you cheater
2:19:14
uhhuh I didn't even consider this all of a sudden my computer just lagged the crap out I'm getting frames sorry mate
2:19:20
wait how did you get
2:19:31
oh the no way is this the Mercer
2:19:42
sphere oh where'd you go oh the astrobiologist Dr DM Mercer was the
2:19:48
first to recognize the presence and probable Fe of these alien artifacts these chain melted State spheres are
2:19:54
named in his honor each sphere emits a unique signal research it in the m to
2:19:59
establish locally appropriate classification and application all right let's go home I saw something over here
2:20:05
that's interesting go that's where I'm going to
2:20:12
go this is copper
2:20:22
Daniel I'mma head
2:20:33
home oh you already picked you're picked are you picked you picked God damn it I
2:20:40
probably proba I picked it or me or you
2:21:00
[Music] what are you oh it's our Miner hey I'm
2:21:07
home oh yeah I see the giant uh the giant conveyor
2:21:17
belt all right ma'am let's go and shove some stuff in you
2:21:25
oh you want me to do the the Mercer Stone Mercer here you said yeah yeah go for
2:21:38
it please choose a new known n tree to begin analysis Mercer spere analysis completed
2:21:46
established local planetary signature of massage 2 AB B in the local Mercer
2:21:51
sphere signals allowing them to be tracked by the object scanner Mercer spheres can also transmit data between
2:21:58
specific witness our scripture witness our Windows have you come to defile our Shrine sing arguing the existence of
2:22:06
intelligent alien life while Fixit has figured out the method all of the original data is still
2:22:14
untranslatable you you didn't get that popup yeah what pop up all right all
2:22:19
right funny guy
2:22:30
the metal has been named cerium after fixit's greatest CEO Katerina Parks it
2:22:36
has been added as a viable alternative to gold in industrial applications specifically in advanced electronics due
2:22:43
to its super conductivity malleability and corrosion resistance
2:22:52
this semi slug now dubbed power slug is early in its life cycle and has retained only part of its potential energy
2:22:59
storage capacity giving it its blue color power slugs are capable of extracting latent energy from their
2:23:05
surroundings including through a form of photosynthesis and preserve it in their poorest semicrystalline shell over their
2:23:12
lifetime this explains why they rarely move after having found a suitable location
2:23:21
did you put your um the summer Sloop wh the summer Sloop the
2:23:33
hoodie the hoodie this fruit du the pale Berry due to its tendency to stay Light
2:23:39
In Color even when rip is compatible with the human digestive system and has been added to the object scanner I'm
2:23:45
waiting forar avilable Tex to go away all right put put the the dude in there
2:23:51
you have it I'm putting it in that's what I'm
2:23:59
saying Summers slop analysis completed summers sloops are somewhere between battery and conduit harvesting energy
2:24:06
from pockets of space with complete disregard for the rules of the SpaceTime Continuum and distributing it into its
2:24:12
connected ecosystem sure sure I see this energy let the effies Harvest until the waves reach our Shores cons similarities
2:24:21
to the hypothetical force of dark energy to potentially be one and the same it
2:24:26
can now be tracked by the object SC fantastic oh sweet fantastic all right do you have any
2:24:32
other stuff we can put in here um oh I have uh yeah I have
2:24:38
some this
2:24:46
guy myia this fruit the the barrel nut after
2:24:51
its distinctive color is compatible with the human digestive system and has been added to the object scanner further
2:24:58
research is
2:25:03
available oh I have one of
2:25:12
these The Remains researched belong to an organism with eight jointed legs
2:25:17
similar to the legs of standard distri distribution and function because its attacks focus on
2:25:23
stabbing prey with the ends of their legs which resemble insectoid Stingers they have been dubbed Stingers obvious
2:25:30
remains can now be made into alien protein and additional research May reveal options for improving Pioneer
2:25:36
safety during exploration
2:25:42
mhm yeah I made some uh Alien protein can we is that anything
2:25:48
we can turn into uh you put in the back in the mems is there uh we need five
2:25:55
give me uh or make make some more protein and then yeah let see if I can make some more I have some hog proteins how many
2:26:02
do you have I have four if you want to make it oh here you go I'll put it in the chest for you
2:26:12
nice bio Oran or bioorganic
2:26:18
properties rewards alien alien protein can now be turned into
2:26:24
biomass or alien DNA capsules in addition to being used for research the
2:26:29
invaluable alien life form data in these capsules can be traded for Fixit coupons at the awesome sync we guarantee the
2:26:36
best capsule to coupon exchange rate anywhere on this
2:26:42
planet right right yeah yeah yeah um what are
2:26:47
you feeling what we making more uh biofuel more biofuel
2:26:53
biomass biofuel all these leaves that I have that does appear to be what we need to do
2:27:20
all right uh let's see here what do we need to
2:27:29
build what are you building over there I'm just moving this up
2:27:37
top um we need a we need uh iron
2:27:47
plates how many do we have like
2:27:55
300 uh yeah we have enough plates and then we need uh
2:28:12
the how many reinforcements and oh what were these guys connected to
2:28:20
here I think
2:28:53
many iron on me do I I need 15 more uh
2:29:09
rods I like how large all of the like items are that we make yeah yeah I like how they're like
2:29:15
really big like the like the copper spools if you go stand next to to the um
2:29:21
I added a container for the copper spools like super small no they're gigantic no no we are oh yeah we're real
2:29:28
tiny compared to
2:29:43
them um oh yeah we should start making um
2:29:51
uhuh what we we really need to get the uh the biomass automated to some extent
2:29:57
is that is that like possible uh yes we need like maybe a storage and
2:30:05
then we could put all our biomass oh and then have that pipe out we need a we need a
2:30:10
Constructor dedicated to building
2:30:16
um we need a Constructor dedicated to building uh
2:30:21
biomass yeah and then that thing's going to loop back in and beat it into
2:30:28
M full
2:30:47
circle no say a so
2:30:57
so know carry me
2:31:04
home all right let's get this iron
2:31:10
rods enough I need six
2:31:16
more all right perfect that's that done
2:31:21
now I need all of the crews in the
2:31:44
world um
2:32:12
can we make another Rod production uh you want
2:32:17
rods yeah cuz like you see these yeah I'm making I'm making this one right now I got to make
2:32:23
um more of those fancy plates oh okay that's what I'm that's
2:32:29
what I've been working on fancy plates like fancy plate
2:32:34
automation not automation but just fan but we should make fancy play
2:32:43
automation we're almost we're like halfway
2:32:48
there oh we we can't automate them because it needs two
2:32:54
units um I feel fairly confident that there is
2:33:00
ability to pipe two things in well no no no that's what we're working on right
2:33:06
now we don't have the thing to pipe two things into one
2:33:11
oh we need the uh the assembly which is what I think we're
2:33:17
working on no oh not working there's no power why
2:33:24
are we working on
2:33:30
Logistics we're working on the wrong thing oh oh
2:33:41
well these uh these poles suck why is that they are the worst I
2:33:49
not to keep comparing the two games but it's very frust you wanted more H
2:33:55
rods uh more Rod production yeah okay because the iron over there is like
2:34:01
really slow
2:34:08
as not sure why it's like stalled so maybe we can make that more efficient there what's stalling the the
2:34:16
iron like the iron coming like the raw iron no the raw Iron's
2:34:21
good it's over here that it gets down here I think I I think it's
2:34:29
because I don't know why like here like here
2:34:39
is there's 100 iron in this this guy right now yeah I don't know why
2:34:46
like so what's the problem that this is stopped it's it's not flowing cons like I just
2:34:53
moved all the iron out oh the amount of time it takes to put one iron in of time
2:34:59
it takes for one iron out it's little strange is yeah cuz we make 30 iron per minute
2:35:05
and we only make oh getting dou that makes sense it's
2:35:11
getting the
2:35:17
output huh so it's not a bad issue if we like you know stay on top
2:35:23
yeah but we can make it faster I mean
2:35:28
how do you uh how do you pull out of storage containers is it like really
2:35:35
simple uh got a get a conveyor belt and pull
2:35:43
out
2:35:48
this yeah it's that that simple just have the conveyor Bell come
2:35:56
out okay so we can
2:36:03
um okay I think I see what we can do here we can um I'm going to move our copper
2:36:10
production I think what I got to move it I got I got
2:36:15
to move it elsewhere it's like in the way of what we there there there's something very blatant we need to be
2:36:21
doing and we're scared we're
2:36:26
afraid what do you mean fuse is blown
2:36:34
dad whatever could you
2:36:48
mean hey making these things one by
2:36:55
one I need like 50 of them man [ __ ] wire is oh I guess you did make it at
2:37:00
max distance yeah man ah I guess that's on
2:37:12
me now
2:37:22
oh
2:37:31
God ran out of material yeah was all powered now
2:38:08
back plates 11 ples four more
2:38:16
plates H isn't it isn't it all pretty I have't L me a second it is uh is so
2:38:23
pretty it's a beauty oh
2:38:31
yeah oh yeah going straight from the underground I like
2:38:37
it why is this stopped no
2:38:42
power did you forget to connect something that isn't selling me at
2:38:48
all I that does not sound like me in the
2:39:03
slightest why is this making rods oh that's what you
2:39:09
wanted I I why is this making rods I thought you going to make the rods next
2:39:15
to the other rod know like have a rod by Rod
2:39:21
comparison oh I you could you could change it you know what I mean I I get I get what you're
2:39:38
saying yeah cuz this guy is full again this I I I am working on a
2:39:46
solution I just need some
2:39:52
time don't worry you work on your thing I'm working on the objectives and then we'll whoa whoa whoa what are what are
2:40:00
you saying right now I'm working on the objective you work on your thing you you
2:40:06
work on your little fun game I'll work on like the actual game play this not g we'll meet up not
2:40:14
gameplay this is you're having way more fun
2:40:22
I had to build 50 of those stupid uh reinforc
2:40:31
plates why is it so
2:40:36
slow what the [ __ ] is your problem I don't know
2:40:46
man so slow oh cuz it's impure that's why what is
2:40:52
the problem what am I not understanding
2:40:58
what's going on it won't like connect oh all right that works I don't I don't
2:41:07
know no wait did that not work either you built it
2:41:14
backwards oh dude I thought they just figured that
2:41:19
out themselves okay that makes a lot more
2:41:28
sense I'm not looking forward to having to build 200 sandbags or whatever you want to call
2:41:42
them what what
2:41:59
I I now I now see what the problem is and it was it was the smelter all along that was what was messing me up I I I
2:42:07
keep forgetting which one's the input and which one's the
2:42:12
output is it worth nope yeah it is or
2:42:19
ah I have been messing with this for oh my God
2:42:31
please okay there we go now now that and then we got
2:42:42
this I don't know what what is this guy this this you this furnace here
2:42:47
you no all right word all
2:42:55
right okay and then you're going to make
2:43:01
wire look at that look at this movement fight fight
2:43:09
uh I can slide one way turn it around the other way oh I see they just adding that
2:43:16
singular item blew everything
2:43:22
yeah maybe it's worth building another uh thing over there another burner
2:43:30
um so this I I
2:43:38
okay you want another burner over there um whatever works I'm not I'm not I'm
2:43:45
I'm not picky or do you want me to put it by the other burners then we just bring a wire all the way
2:43:54
over I can do that too I'm not picking
2:44:03
man oh I need RS okay
2:44:20
all right I need power where is
2:44:25
uh who's got like only like two right now oh go I found
2:44:35
him missing cable
2:44:50
I'm working on big things here Daniel big things big things big things
2:45:00
happening oh I just stored all my stuff in there all right now that this is good I
2:45:08
need you you need another wire a this big ass Rock is in my
2:45:16
way can I play stuff on this
2:45:22
well not
2:45:27
no bu
2:45:38
over I'm thinking of a slightly worse solution
2:45:43
D which could [Music] be that building over it you know build
2:45:50
under it right that's going to entirely depend on
2:45:55
if I can place this right here I'm missing material that's why
2:46:00
okay it's coming along we need
2:46:06
uh oh it's churn you're doing you're doing stuff what do we need no no you're
2:46:11
doing stuff what do we need what do we need I'm working on more uh Constructors
2:46:19
yes sir I love that keep it up I love Constructors love Constructors the more
2:46:26
Constructors you build the less I I'm working
2:46:33
Daniel the power is out which one I don't know you're the power guy
2:46:40
there did you build a burner over here or something oh most likely uh it looks to be connected
2:46:50
[Music] uh uh he connects here he connects there
2:46:55
he connects through here
2:47:01
oh Daniel the the grid is too much
2:47:07
power I built another one don't worry all cool cool I don't want to build more of these
2:47:13
Garbage Guys I need I need this automated uh
2:47:21
yeah I'm I'm with you on that like
2:47:28
10 16 let's put that there uh where do you want this
2:47:33
wire there you go does that do anything for you not of Me
2:47:40
no what's what's not working here who who isn't working which one of you not me boss not
2:47:47
me uh this one goes into four this one goes into that
2:47:54
one uh which goes into here which goes into there which goes plates those which goes
2:48:02
into here respectfully Daniel I'm turning uh well just for the time being I'm
2:48:09
going to switch one of our iron rods over to iron
2:48:14
plates any more iron place I already finished my uh
2:48:21
I need it for the reinforced and
2:48:29
so I really wish there was a faster way to get um what's it called
2:48:37
concrete okay we're at a point now where I need to I'm using so many of these I need to put into a hot bar item all
2:48:43
right
2:48:49
I built a a fresh uh biomass fuel thing so you have a lot more energy going
2:48:55
through your yeah you got to figure out which cable
2:49:00
needs to be connected to where that's good need more plates this is going to
2:49:08
be a a recurring theme I have I have 58 on me if you want I'm going to need I'm going to need all that I'm going to put
2:49:15
in the chest
2:49:22
I'm having to go running back and forth to get these uh these
2:49:29
rocks I need 50 more sandbags what why do you keep calling
2:49:35
them sandbags they look like the
2:49:40
sandbags okay
2:49:50
all right 30 20 23 more to go I'm just going to set it all up first before I start dising
2:49:57
anything oh of course you're in the way oh I just St all my
2:50:04
stuff who connects to you there is one wire that you can use
2:50:11
to connect every don't want to use this you just let me know
2:50:27
need 11 more uh
2:50:37
Hey
2:50:43
right doing the Lord's work there
2:50:51
wasn't letting me
2:51:09
cry all right can't wait to find out what we need to build after
2:51:14
this any more iron plates
2:51:20
oh oh we finished a milestone fix it would like to remind you obligation
2:51:26
towards efficiency bels and lifts
2:51:31
toward on theay efficient don't disappoint fix
2:51:36
it all right
2:51:42
uh all right this is not as bad not as bad
2:51:48
this one is the one we should have been doing but we never did
2:51:55
okay um I need all the rods I need all the
2:52:06
plates everything
2:52:27
h no more rods and this is a whole I have rods uh
2:52:33
or or you have rods over by you the [ __ ] there're somewhere
2:52:40
uh you got rods right what is this there a Constructor where the [ __ ] are the
2:52:47
rods they're being built into Nails oh that's what I'm looking
2:52:52
at so now I don't have rods me converting them
2:53:00
[Music] all all right I need him oh I get him man I need
2:53:08
500 Nails all right and then oh this is
2:53:15
horrendous you need to go there yep this is this is this is this is getting
2:53:20
really difficult to navigate through uh yeah that's what this about to say I don't really know how to we have 500
2:53:27
Nails ex wait no no no you need to be Daniel yep yep
2:53:35
yep okay I got to I got to get a bur ey I'm I'm having a tough time figuring out where I'm
2:53:42
going yep yep yep yep okay you're you're next so we got to move this but
2:53:53
back I haven't had to worry about Concrete in so long and I need more
2:54:00
concrete good thing I've been using literally all over
2:54:10
yeah ooh you want to hear the best part yeah I'm sure this is going to be the best part what's up uh
2:54:16
soon we're going to get faster conveyor belts um
2:54:22
okay I guess what needs to be used to make them
2:54:29
concrete reinforced plates oh yeah that's a that's a tough
2:54:37
cookie that's that's a tough one I need I need stop the produ nails
2:54:49
these nails need to not be made turn that boy
2:55:00
off I I I don't know what you're making just make yeah just make that that's fine we'll fix you
2:55:10
later okay and then I need to give
2:55:20
[Music] okay I think the last goon is you and
2:55:26
you're connected to someone over there that's
2:55:36
fine why are you why are you this way
2:55:52
no
2:55:58
no like all the iron rods in the
2:56:08
world okay and then uh you have to go I don't know somewhere
2:56:20
okay that should that should be looking better I think okay I need to rewire everything
2:56:34
still I'm back here and I get lost every single time okay that looks good I need
2:56:39
to re uh I need I need better power managements I built one that is uh new
2:56:49
how much do these cost okay I
2:56:58
need you going to fix the the power man oh yeah I'm going to fix it at least for these guys appreciate it cuz it looks
2:57:08
nasty what's going on here oh this is a new one uh is this supposed to be the
2:57:15
biomass no melter to storage
2:57:21
dor all the rods uh go to the back go to the very back go to the very back check
2:57:26
the I don't need it I got enough IR if yeah if you need anything iron related head to the very back of the line it's
2:57:32
all storage units in the back and then just go through the six of them and then one of them are going to have what you
2:57:38
need I think I think I I think I'm making two plates and one rod that will change just give
2:57:44
me give me some time
2:57:51
okay that
2:57:57
that jumping across building okay uh is that
2:58:06
enough already over here I wish there was like labels you
2:58:13
know I'll turn you off okay how how many of these do I have
2:58:28
perfect did you just turn off everything all the iron is
2:58:34
off fine I'll do momentarily [Music]
2:58:42
momentarily I guess it would make it would make more sense to have on the other side
2:58:53
like you have so much iron on you oh dude let me my bad let me let me give you some of
2:59:02
this uh I take that CU I'm probably going to
2:59:08
need that here's the raw form in case you need that here's some copper I'm
2:59:15
going to need that in case need that has 250 spools all
2:59:30
right I need these 52 perfect straight into the bank straight
2:59:37
into the bank straight into the bank on to the next
2:59:56
okay oh beautiful okay six more times or five more times now uh now Ryan did you
3:00:03
ever get one for the uh Auto what bof fuel
3:00:08
nope ah bof fuel is not my current uh
3:00:13
agenda I will I will tackle that next if need be
3:00:22
what do I need for that I think everything should have two two two two
3:00:27
two two two perfect okay and then um how do you can you come here cuz
3:00:34
you're the you're kind of you know how the electrical grid works right now so all of these are off the grid right now there are six of these guys um how do
3:00:41
you want me to Route these into a biofuel something into a power uh how you me to Route these I
3:00:48
really don't know how much one can handle okay so I'd run I'd run one first
3:00:54
to make sure how much it well so so there are 12 machines I think one can handle 12 machines
3:01:02
now I don't know now all right we'll find we'll find out I'd say do one at a
3:01:07
time and see how much it can handle all right okay so this one on the corner is only being used over let me let me just
3:01:15
disconnect all these wires all right um if I may I'm going to what
3:01:22
what do I need for I need oh I need more
3:01:28
concrete cuz I want to put that bio thing on on Solid
3:01:36
Ground hey Elane what's going on okay is there anything try wiring one
3:01:43
of these to one line
3:01:50
why does it already say two are used how how are the two
3:02:02
used whatever and then what's the power biomass burner is what it's called
3:02:08
biomass burner yeah
3:02:18
yeah looks good all right so now let's do we're going to start building upwards
3:02:23
that' be cool cover this all up soz we don't have to look at it ever
3:02:34
again uh all right turn everything off after make it
3:02:42
myself okay well it's on but oh because it doesn't that makes sense okay
3:02:54
we're just going to connect them all up for
3:03:02
now yeah them all up all right and then connect it to one and see if it
3:03:10
runs right now three are connected up well six six machines two
3:03:18
six machines are connected up doesn't look like anything's happening so I think we're good for now powered up by just one by just
3:03:26
yeah oh they're flashing yellow does yellow mean they're not working I think
3:03:32
yellow means they're not producing there's no iron oh yeah why is there no iron cuz
3:03:38
I've been picking them up to oh that makes sense I keep moving no that's yep I checked out yeah yeah yeah you're
3:03:45
moving forward all right I I am I am I'm only 200 uh plates away
3:03:52
from the next Milestone then it's going to mess up your entire
3:03:59
production I'm just happy that you're doing this and uh my audio sounds
3:04:06
low let me let me raise up my audio May it's CU I'm not speaking into my
3:04:12
mic H what just happened oh I put one into the floor that was interesting
3:04:21
all right back on the
3:04:27
grind holding one
3:04:37
button um
3:04:50
I already have 100 oh sweet bam right the the
3:04:56
garbage
3:05:11
next you killed the iron production I did had to be done
3:05:20
don't worry my child all will be
3:05:32
well stop making two of them and one of them in the ground is I don't understand
3:05:38
why that is the way okay
3:05:57
[Music]
3:06:10
uh okay uh
3:06:24
need 40
3:06:37
more that check out is that where I SP oh
3:06:54
yeah cuz that side is there that's there and what is this one you get out of the
3:07:07
way okay and then is this even no but
3:07:13
that's fine we're just going to shove this bad
3:07:19
boy right in the middle that's not the
3:07:38
middle out of uh uhoh this is not the time to be out of
3:07:45
things if I'm not careful to put us back to the Stone
3:07:52
[Music] Age I'm not helping at
3:07:59
all I'm just stealing all the
3:08:05
[Music] iron I need what is that 38 more iron
3:08:14
plates [Music]
3:08:26
place I I'm almost
3:08:34
there I need 10 more plates
3:08:55
well now we're in the Stone Age don't say that [Laughter]
3:09:15
Daniel all right Daniel
3:09:21
why is this one blinking red uh I think it's I you haven't told it what to build
3:09:29
that's why oh okay that's you're you're so
3:09:36
right oh I that's that's going to be the same for all of these um I'm going to
3:09:41
make the left three plates and then the right three Rs all right
3:09:53
cool let's head back to the front this power grid and just fail and
3:10:02
then we slowly Power It Up more the uh we don't really need these guys do we [Music]
3:10:14
what so I think we're at the point now where we just don't have enough iron
3:10:21
coming in and we build another iron thing oh
3:10:28
another mine yeah uh where is
3:10:38
it I need I need I need uh stupid uh material
3:10:49
well all right that's one well uh it can't it can't handle all six is that what that means yeah yeah okay so we
3:10:57
need to make two of them then it can't handle it's not six it's 12 one two 12
3:11:04
it can handle 12 things six six rows 12 items all right how about how about we we power up we can make one on each side
3:11:11
how about we power one for each row what
3:11:18
let's let's just make I'll make one on each side right now what are these things called biomass burners yeah
3:11:23
there's one back here you can dismantle this one oh where right here oh
3:11:35
okay pick it up I'm stupid well I was going to say you
3:11:40
should put it by the same side so we both of them with the automatic thing that we're going to build next oh I
3:11:46
figur we were just going to change
3:11:54
the I guess it's the same line um you should be all right so I
3:12:01
need a little bit of biomass Oh see now we have all this iron it's all chocked up right to
3:12:11
roll do we need another Miner still or no uh another oh another iron Miner
3:12:17
absolutely yeah how do you break them in
3:12:38
half all right I'm sure uh any of the sweats that play this game will know the
3:12:45
the amount that a bio whatever can handle oh yeah they definitely do but they just don't want
3:12:50
to tell us yeah we're going to need more iron in so we can cuz we don't we don't need
3:12:55
this splitter right here oh oh there's one right there yeah oh that's easy okay here the
3:13:03
the you you do the left one I'll do the right one what you talking about like you do
3:13:09
the left Miner I'll do the right minor cuz we can just we can pipe we can get rid of this splitter middle one yeah we
3:13:15
can get rid of this the middle splitter and just pipe it straight yeah pipe it straight into the other the other
3:13:28
splitter having to fire plates
3:13:48
oh I can't wait I can't wait ran what's up uh I can't wait for for when you find
3:13:56
out uh what comes
3:14:11
next oh you have no power on this guy nope
3:14:20
that's a waste of power uh oh if I do this guy
3:14:27
here will that will that kill
3:14:34
it doesn't seem to be the
3:14:41
case oh well there's one biofuel in here
3:14:54
yeah there's still not it the the the three-way
3:14:59
splitter is uh too slow it looks like the machines keep turning
3:15:06
off oh you said we're going to get faster conveyors right yeah yeah okay we don't have to worry about that gun these
3:15:12
are going to they're going to fix themselves
3:15:17
what's going on here
3:15:24
what is it doing it on this side too yeah it does it on this side too it gets it's all loopy in this little area
3:15:31
that's funny um also we don't need three
3:15:38
containers so the container three what do you mean three containers like you're saying just pipe
3:15:44
it into one yeah why not just pipe it into one I was I was just holding this out for now in case we wanted to like
3:15:51
pipe one of the like for example you had the you had the pipes we could pipe one set of pipes off to make screws and then
3:15:57
keep one of the other pipes to be just pipes and then we can you know I
3:16:04
see that makes sense uh can you give me some iron
3:16:10
plates yeah
3:16:17
I am almost at the end of the need seven
3:16:35
plates all right now if you go to uh production the assembler can produce
3:16:40
more complex project part SM plating which is crucial for initiating project C two
3:16:47
parts into another to the elev byle your contracted duties as part of you will
3:16:55
definitely be helping achieve Fixit company goals is 2x oh it's a one by two cannot craft
3:17:02
project do not worry about your inadequate crafting skill when compared to an assem dud cost is ridiculous such
3:17:11
as the and commodifying natural resources is that because it ran out or
3:17:16
is it because it's because it ran out it ran out of fuel
3:17:22
um oh our um our copper is also out
3:17:28
um all right oh
3:17:41
my all right how do we automate biomass what do we have to do
3:17:48
we need a Constructor okay I have it uh we need
3:17:53
a storage unit
3:17:59
okay theoretically we need two Constructors now you're asking for too
3:18:08
much I mean actually no we just need one Constructor just keep it with the
3:18:14
one um and then is it facing the
3:18:21
wrong that's good okay and then down here solid biofuel and then no yeah we
3:18:27
need another we need which way which way is the in do you have the in on the left or on the
3:18:33
right let's um all right so so cuz we can I assume
3:18:39
you want to put the the grass in here yeah but it can only fit 200 at a
3:18:46
time all right and these fuels need to get piped in from the
3:18:51
back okay I think I think I know what you want we need two
3:18:58
uh we need two storage containers one for the back and one
3:19:05
front or we just have one in the front or one in the back before we put all the
3:19:11
the biomass I mean and then the front just pipes into all the uh burners and
3:19:16
then we just do Splitters um that way it's constantly being
3:19:29
supplied all right uh
3:20:17
huh oh oh you're just you're just
3:20:24
weird it is weird all right then and then you just got to give it you just
3:20:30
got to give this crafter power and then just put the put the oh
3:20:35
you already have it in there so it's just this thing that needs power so we can just we can we can just um yeah yeah
3:20:43
yeah yeah yeah yeah bingo and then we just got to power this real quick you took all the
3:20:50
biomass
3:20:55
minute all right is this uh is it good
3:21:01
yeah nice but what's the so I mean we don't we don't
3:21:07
technically need this part this is just a a buffer I just put this here in case we want to cut this guy off and then we
3:21:13
have this guy it doesn't really matter we don't really need this guy
3:21:19
we need to provide it with the other side the other side yeah over oh do that side do that
3:21:25
side too well I'm saying or we could just pipe it all the way
3:21:30
over that's why I wanted to have them both next to oh
3:21:36
um damn we just have one long wire that reaches over it's just going to be
3:21:42
ugly like I don't want toot my own horn but this is the first pretty thing we've made
3:21:47
we put we put two of these pillars next to each other and just have the line go all the way
3:21:53
up um you know what I
3:22:05
mean I'm trying to think of how to make this symmetrical I'm not seeing a good way I mean it's it's fine how do you
3:22:12
want to do it hpe what uh here do
3:22:17
this we put it here okay that goes
3:22:24
here this one goes back there this one goes here to the sky this
3:22:31
one goes here oh and then I make a second burner
3:22:38
the uh and then we put the other burner I don't need that one we move the other burner over yeah
3:22:52
uh what side should the in come from uh do we have space back here make
3:23:00
the entrance facing facing what facing this way there there not really facing
3:23:05
this way towards the rock uh see if I can like hide it behind the
3:23:11
rock yeah I guess you could I guess you could do that way
3:23:17
then we need a splitter oh God you're going to get a I
3:23:23
don't know if you're fitting a splitter back there I guess you you might be able
3:23:39
to
3:23:44
okay this is uh yeah I don't know if it's going to fit in the back there
3:23:51
[Music] Brody oh you want to keep this the same
3:24:04
direction uh is that too
3:24:11
tight uh
3:24:17
why is it oh that's
3:24:27
fine uh too
3:24:33
tight um I'm I'm going to let you do it
3:24:39
there's too many cooks over here I'm getting in your way
3:24:53
is set number seven oh I guess we need to start a new
3:25:06
Milestone the resource sync bonus program I I think we should do the jump
3:25:11
pads that sounds way more fun it's not worth it no I me no it takes energy oh
3:25:19
it takes like oh no I mean we can't yeah we can't there's I mean it's it's either
3:25:24
the jump pads or the resource sync bonus both are equally as bad that's what I'm
3:25:30
thinking the resource sync bonus is the only one that
3:25:36
uh doesn't cost like batteries or whatever the rotors yeah whatever those
3:25:43
are
3:25:50
I'm uh I'm be honest Daniel I'm kind of good to call it here you know I'm not against that yeah
3:25:56
I think it's a good little oh this
3:26:06
is uh I am uncertain where the hell are
3:26:13
you is this this is not looking uh
3:26:20
then we can remove the storage unit that might that might give us some more room to play
3:26:25
with I think it's fine yeah
3:26:35
yeah all right there we go there we go
3:26:50
[Music] uh I think the next thing we need to do is really focus on our uh building a guy
3:26:59
building a what we need to make a a reinforce uh plate generator oh yeah we
3:27:05
can we can extend out backwards um I'm just saying that's I think that's the next step for what we need to do I
3:27:11
agree um because then we'll be able to get a lot more um materials out of
3:27:20
there and then we still got to build the space thingy which elev the only yeah the only
3:27:29
thing that's going to hurt us the I mean we have we could I'd say we should honestly
3:27:36
wait and build a space thing first before we build yeah we could we
3:27:43
could um we could spend the time just kind of like cleaning up the base getting the
3:27:48
getting our copper and we can do the exact same thing we did with this but with
3:27:54
copper you know cuz we I mean the space elevator is going to
3:28:00
need a whole bunch of copper
3:28:05
oh so we could build a space elevator I'm not oppos why is the copper thing not
3:28:12
working oh there's no uh Power going to it none of this working the Limestone or the
3:28:18
um there nothing connected to it it's just not there's just no
3:28:25
power oh did I never turn it on there's just no power in
3:28:30
here no connection we just never turned it on we just never turned it on oh
3:28:46
there we go these are still not connected um I
3:28:53
guess I just never connected them back after I moved oh no what I had never connected the other uh Power
3:28:59
Line the other power line oh these aren't just these aren't connected at all no I don't think
3:29:06
so oh we have the other power lane connect drop one down there and I can
3:29:11
connect it well I can just connect this into
3:29:16
I guess that
3:29:23
works oh yep that was too much adding those two on I think broke
3:29:37
it I think this is a problem for next time we play why is it broken I think it's too
3:29:44
many things connected oh this one needs to be taken out and then this
3:29:49
one that's our iron too we can't have
3:29:57
that there we go I I I disconnected the copper oh I why because I'd rather I'd
3:30:04
rather our iron oh or why is this one off
3:30:10
oh put put that one back uh let's
3:30:25
see all right this goes here I think it's going
3:30:31
to I think it's going to break it up as soon as you do it no it's cuz what the the one
3:30:40
guy what it's cuz there's too many oh cuz is powering
3:30:49
to wait no they're both running why are you off it has no fuel oh cuz none of this
3:30:57
shit's running I the the this isn't the the
3:31:03
splitter is not splitting it's not it's not uh outputting anything I'm I'm I'm removing the
3:31:09
storage did I build it wrong I built it wrong that's why
3:31:19
that's why is
3:31:26
it
3:31:37
splitter right and then just reconnect your lines
3:32:02
there we [Laughter] go now let's
3:32:11
see wow I like this little junk here look
3:32:17
how it merges look how it merges wow how
3:32:22
nice oh look all right so now as long as we have biomass which we have a as long as we
3:32:28
have leaves is that all that is just leaves it's it's it's biomass so we need
3:32:33
to biom biomass biomass is easy to make it only so we we need we need one layer
3:32:41
further yeah but it's the thing that it's like we have to pick up the leaves either way way right but we're still
3:32:47
having to craft the leaves into the biomass plop the biomass in here I think I yeah but you do that like
3:32:54
after every Expedition you just drop it in go right but you no no we that's what I'm saying we still have to craft the
3:33:00
leaves into biomass we don't I don't want to make another Constructor for that I don't
3:33:05
want another power drain it really only takes a couple of
3:33:13
seconds unless you pick up like a billion like leaves or whatever I guess we'll come to it when
3:33:20
it's a problem yeah I'm good to call it here I'm I'm
3:33:26
good to call it here too think we did a lot of stuff to the I'm going to go to the top of the let's see from above yeah I'll join
3:33:35
you we're going to have to move this guy oh yeah I already had to move once I was
3:33:40
watching without audio for a bit it's funny seeing how you can't place buildings next to each other
3:33:45
oh yeah look at that that's pretty sick look at us Daniel how much uh how
3:33:53
much further did you get uh I built the space elevator okay
3:34:00
uh I finished Milestone two and that's it okay so we're only
3:34:06
we're almost done with two I really get that far yeah no I didn't get that cool and mine is not as
3:34:13
organized or as yours that's this one H I love seeing all the
3:34:20
squares yeah I don't have any foundations you don't have any foundations for yours no it's just it's just all on the floor yeah I thought
3:34:27
about that it was like it's like the foundations are really annoying really early on but then as soon as you have
3:34:33
like the core of your [ __ ] like on the ba on the like Foundation what's really going to be
3:34:38
annoying is uh if we start getting really really really big um the world's not very even so it's
3:34:46
going to we're going to get into some jams later on we're going to have to like conveyor things up like a level I think
3:34:54
it would be cool if you put the space station up there oh okay P it
3:35:01
uh it doesn't let me put it up there all the way over here oh on that guy yeah
3:35:06
that'd be cool or like we could even put it like yeah I'm thinking like on top of
3:35:13
one of the big mountains would be fun I'm okay piping something really far away I think we should put it like right
3:35:20
here oh just right on top yeah that'd be good that be right above everything yeah I think that makes the
3:35:26
most sense I think everyone um can we do uh
3:35:32
let me see this oh I need concrete hold
3:35:39
on oh my God thank God he told us how to slide I would not have ever thought that we could slide in this game
3:35:47
all the concrete I just had I got
3:35:55
me ouch did I just trash all the concrete I had on me
3:36:01
no I try to see if I can like drag it
3:36:13
out guess I can't
3:36:20
all right can you uh are you still up there or no I'll go up one
3:36:29
second yeah I'm up here can you uh can you place it on this
3:36:36
thing all this still still uh two it's so big
3:36:42
okay no we don't want to have this like right here I'd rather be piping stuff I
3:36:48
think it'll be so funny if we have it above us what if we just you
3:36:53
know uh build it over on this this nice little like area that's not being used
3:37:00
you know this this nice area over
3:37:06
here I think that's a good area do you have power redundancy bro we
3:37:12
I don't even know I couldn't tell you even if I wanted
3:37:20
to all right can you place it on this I mean yeah no way does it give you
3:37:27
the well I guess we don't have the resources to be able to verify I mean let's
3:37:32
you yeah we could wow isn't that great yeah you just want to keep moving
3:37:38
it up every just keep layering on top of everything just block out the sky at
3:37:44
some point yeah yeah just block out the sky and then we're good to
3:37:52
go even higher can we go even higher we go even higher wait come come up here if
3:37:58
you can
3:38:09
yeah jump jump and then view one of these the [ __ ] is that what's up what's up with the
3:38:15
floating Coke bags oh huh do you not see
3:38:21
this do you not see oh those are my those are those are my my
3:38:26
concretes you can you can drop stuff I thought I got rid of
3:38:32
them even higher we probably kill ourselves at
3:38:38
some point oh there is there is a limit to how high we go but if if there's a limit to how high
3:38:45
we can go we might as well just build it at the highest level right the the what the
3:38:53
elevator what what are we putting at the I don't know what what are we putting at
3:38:59
what are we putting at the top a you told me oh dude I see
3:39:05
um you see over there one of those Mercer spheres that's the one we already found
3:39:11
from before no that's a different one all right save the
3:39:18
game Chernobyl day one this place is going to blow
3:39:34

3:39:40
minutes yeah 3 hours and 37 minutes I think we did good be
3:39:51
great if you look at the the home screen you can see like the the little thing in the back there little thing in the
3:39:58
back yeah that that straight is goes that's the that's the tower oh
3:40:04
man it it goes straight up I think it would be funnier if we
3:40:11
actually elate everything uh above the tower [Music]
3:40:18
and then have it go straight through our uh straight through
3:40:25
our straight through the factory you know just a straight line that goes up straight
3:40:30
